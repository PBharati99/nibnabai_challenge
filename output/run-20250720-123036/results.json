Even though I'm not a heavy duty user and mainly use it at home. Warranty repair denied claiming its due to physical damage (no it's not). Paying for the repair from my pocket, which requires replacing the entire screen section, would cost 70% of the original purchase cost.\n\nLooking around I could hardly find any matte 2,8K display laptops on the market where I live and I'm aiming for that due to switching to Linux and needing a display without fractional scaling. The only other options I was able to find are a couple of Lenovos - Ideapad Pros and Yoga 7 Slims - priced between $1100-1400. Or some Lenovo T14s around $2200. Compared to these the Framework is not a bad deal at all, especially factoring in the repairability.\n\nThe only valid downside I agree with is the rounded corners on the screen offered only with squared bezels. I mean it just seems so straightforward to create bezels with the same rounded corners around the edges that I can't even fathom why Framework hasn't been doing it.",

This gives an indication as to what I can expect in future\u2026that\u2019s a bargain!!  Plus, as Framework grows in popularity, economies of scale should push the price down.\n\nSecondly, when you upgrade your motherboard, you can repurpose your old motherboard eg as a server and there are free downloadable 3D printer case designs for Framework motherboards. \n\nTherefore, upon upgrading I get TWO computers not one new one\u2026you need to add in the price of a free secondhand computer/server into the equation.\n\nThirdly, computers break..it\u2019s a fact of life and the cost of repair is negligible with Framework compared to any other brand\u2026and some brands are impossible to repair which means you have to replace the ENTIRE LAPTOP.  This huge cost is missing from his analysis.\n\nFourthly, he doesn\u2019t properly factor the value of recycling and waste prevention\u2026he\u2019s just another mindless consumer who moans about the environment but does nothing about it even when the solution is in his hands.  The cognitive dissonance is palpable but he dismisses it. \n\nLastly, as a Linux user, it\u2019s fantastic to have a brand that\u2019s put support of Linux as a primary goal.",

Most Intel, AMD and Snapdragon allow you to upgrade the SSD so I am not sure what Frameworks USP will mean next year? I would not be surprised if they struggle. LPCAMM2 looks like it is mainly for pro & gaming PCs due to the size, but maybe they will work, although they are currently 2-3X more expensive and upgrading 16GB to 32GB means you have to buy a 32GB CAMM2 board rather than just add 16GB. \n\nThe business model looks dicey hence the prices being poor value.",

Being able to upgrade is great. Until it is the best option compared to the competition, with all other things being equal, it will continue to be a hard sell. Props to Framework for being one of the first to offer what enthusiasts have been asking for, just hopefully eventually they're able to get to a future where they can price in line with other manufacturers, and hopefully other manufacturers follow suit with this model as well.

If you bump your ram, storage, and screen back down on the framework to actually match the yoga and the price someone would realistically pay, the delta isn't as bad as you make it out to be.\n\nNot saying the still ~$300 premium isn't significant, but I don't think it's too unfair a price to pay for something that will be able to theoretically stay around a lot longer and not be completely replaced when I want to upgrade in a couple years. That yoga is almost entirely irreparable too. You break anything on it and it's essentially waste.\n\nIn my eyes, you buy the initial unit for 300 more, upgrade two years later like you likely would for the yoga at ~$400 like you mentioned, and you've already broken even. Any upgrades after that is money saved. It's a longer game but I much prefer that path myself.",

All the sudden its cheaper than having to buy an entirely new laptop. Also - Ryzen 7040 did come out a little over a year ago.

It's fine that the laptop isnt for you, but I think overarchingly you missed the point. Its a laptop designed around being repairable and replaceable. Buy once and have something solid for 5+ years or maybe longer. This isnt a laptop for people who want to be on the bleeding edge. If they can afford a Microsoft surface laptop or xps 13 every 2 years and dont care about what happens to their old computer then yeah, do that. This is for people who want to keep their workhorse. That will take 20 minutes to repace the battery and appreciate how easy it is.\n\nI wouldnt describe that crowd as enthusiast. Enthusiasts are buying razer blades or asus rog 14, or even macs. This is repair and sustainability focused. Webcam breaks? You can buy a replacement just like that.",

They're constantly putting out new mainboards and shipping as fast as they presumably can; they're making 100% repairable devices designed with the technical user in mind; they're giving the users all the choices in the world when it comes to a laptop.\nI'd say the price is entirely fair for that.

For that price and the cost for upgrading the parts is similar to just buy a new laptop, No CHANCE, even with the argument \"framework is for the enthusiast and the repairability is up on the roof\", it'll be a REASONABLE device/laptop to purchase, in terms of price to performance (lets face it, this is still important for everyone). All the problem here is in the price, i mean Framework is still considered new after all. I think it just needs time. \n\nBUT if they really want this product to NOT compete with a greater market (a market where people use laptop for work, including designing, editing, etc.), facing ASUS, LENOVO, etc. and they 100% focused for the enthusiast and tech fans (and/or developers, engineers), then yeah, putting a high price on that advantage and the uniqueness of that product is super ACCEPTABLE.",

          "content": "Austin's take was solely in respect to the market the most average joe would face and that's completely fine take, that is HIS audience. But I would have liked to see some effort into diving into the ethos of the company's product (laptop) he is reviewing on, and who the actual audience for that is. They market their laptop for everyone because even if one didn't intend to have a laptop that lasts, and reduce E-waste, they would be contributing towards a better cause while also getting an okay system, and now the tech has evolved over the years - having an Okay system is all most people need including the average joe. Students, not so much like me :)\n (I am really tempted though)\n\nThe point of having that CPU upgrade is not so you can buy it every 6 months to be up to date, but to have a new system 4 years down the line to a higher spec, without adjusting to a new laptop with their own bios system, instabilities and quirks. If I own a car, I want to Own that and not be thinking like replacing the whole thing because something is cheaper to buy as a whole then just maintaining it - economics sense? ye maybe but you have to again adjust to it, get your muscle memory build over time. Besides the goal of Framework is entirely different from the market and they even standing close to competing, and desirable I might add? It is just awesome to be a part of it.\n\nApple ffs have been doing this since forever, people justifying the prices saying, it's for R&D, the software upgrade, the consistency and they all but given us laptops with no ports, keyboards that breaks, display that dies for no user error AT ALL. People still backed that up because of familiarity and the software ecosystem unison with their hardware (dongles and whatever but it works as the user expects) but then again, they were also being held hostage by that same company.\n\nWhatever framework is doing is by choice, the pricing is by choice while also trying their best to price for the competition despite being a low volume manufacturer. And the users are trying prop them up to have that ecosystem last and prosper till it becomes a no brainer to stick to framework and just wait for a newer hardware that just makes sense to upgrade.\n\nI didn't even mention about the saying the environment thing because frankly most people cannot justify buying specifically for that cause only because most can't afford that premium. If that was the case, then it would make sense for framework to never upgrade their hardware design and just bulk order just the motherboard and have that be updated every 6 months. And that is just as sad as buying a whole new laptop imo, because that ain't really solving the core cause either.",

Sure, you might upgrade your laptop every year or two, but good luck getting a new battery or replacing a broken USB port on most mainstream laptops.

And if you want more RAM, you have to buy the higher storage model, which just hikes up the cost. Comparing the 'cheapest' orange to the 'cheapest' apple (fruit, not the company) is just plain wrong. They\u2019re in completely different categories.\n\nYes, the Framework might seem expensive, but that\u2019s partly because they\u2019re still growing and don\u2019t have the massive market share to negotiate lower component prices.

You can swap out a lot of parts (the main board, the RAM, storage, even the battery) and even upgrade them (For example, I am planning to swap from a 11th Gen Intel to the AMD board). You dont show updraging the board. \n\nThe new screen's rounded corners are indeed a drawback, but looks minor to me. Thing is they either had the choice to get a squared cornered screen but make it more expensive or go with that pre made model for cheaper, and the latter was the selected choice. Blame bigger companies for making this design popular. \n\nTo me, having a laptop being repairable AND upgradeable is something I love, even if I have to sacrifice some things.\n\nI hope you can remake this review to shows the potential it has rather than comparing it to another laptop for performance and price, because that is not what Framework is about. They are rebuilding the path that bigger companies have abandoned for years.",

          "content": "Ok so, I am not one to comment often but I feel your comparison to the Lenovo to be way off, for several reasons, and it does Framework a great disservice.\nAnd as someone that has been looking in the farthest corners for a laptop that suits me and my needs, I have looked at this Lenovo already, and the specs are horribly misleading on the product page.\n\nThe Lenovo you showed had the following specs (model: 83DK000DUS, Model number shown at 16:54)\n - Ryzen 5 8640HS (a little bit quicker than the Ryzen 5 7640U, sure)\n - 8GB of completely non-upgradeable RAM (Yes, I double-checked, you need to order enough when you buy it, Lenovo explicitly lists it as Soldered LPDDR5)\n\n - a 512GB SSD (likely a cheaper offering than those from Framework, which are WD Black model drives, the SN770 or SN850X)\n - a \"2k\" display, bonus being touch (Lenovo lists it as a 1920x1200 300nit 60Hz IPS panel, which is NOT even close to the 2.8k 2880x1920 500nit 120HZ display you got on the Framework)\n - The Lenovo is a 2-in-1 model which IS a bonus, sure\n - You compared the Lenovo at its sale price, of $450, which it is no longer on sale and is $750\n\nSo, a better comparison would be an HP Pavilion Plus 14Z-EY100 with the 1TB upgrade, which has an MSRP of $1120 for the Ryzen 5 with 16GB of RAM and a 2560x1600 120hz IPS 300nit display or $1260 for the Ryzen 7 with 16GB of RAM and the 2880x1800 120hz 400-500nit OLED display, I am sure there are other similar comparisons, but it is one I have found during my searching.\n\nI love the content Austin but please make sure your due diligence is done for something like this, as the Framework and Lenovo are in completely different categories (a higher end version of the same Lenovo model would make a better comparison instead). I feel very as though the view taken here was very skewed to which I can say I am very disappointed, but I still look forward to future videos.",

And this degree of modularity comes at a solidity cost, that's a worthwhile trade-off.\nYou do have a point with the new price, but that's where the second hand market steps in, where you can make a new laptop with the old board of someone else for a good deal.\nAnd it's meant as a laptop of Theseus that lasts, unlike the alternative suggestion you gave that needs to be replaced in it's entirety after 5 years.\nIn conclusion, one of the worst showcases of tech hardware I've seen in a while, not a good for me first impression of this channel.

That means there's at least partial schematics for every component, which is good news for third party hardware/software! \nOh also, the lag in adopting the latest hardware is probably that they want to ensure those CPUs's work long term without any faults.

This is not made clear on the website but the price that was shown in the video for the DIY Version does not inclued all the neccessary parts while the predbuild version does. If you get the DIY Version you should get your own RAM, storage and OS as Framework charges a significant premium for these. The price difference actually makes sense because they have to build all laptops for quality control. The DIY versions are actually disassembled after that so they require more work. \n\nAlso the value of these laptops is not in the specs but in the repairebility and upgradebility. If you want the most perfomance per dollar this is simply not the laptop for you. There are tons of options that offer these. But there is bearely any (if any at all) other laptops that do offer what the framework does. And there are a lot of people that value repairibility an upgradebility over pure performance. There are already some manufactures that implement more rapairible designs in their laptops but as far as i know none of them go as far as framework with the concept. Right now they still offer a very unique product.\n\nI know that Austin did mention some of my points but his overall conclusion was a more negative than what i think framework deserves.",

Instead, they\u2019re focused on giving us a laptop that lasts\u2014a device you can upgrade over time without breaking the bank.\n\nIn a world where replacing a screen on a $500 laptop can cost almost half of its value, or where a tiny issue with soldered components means tossing the whole laptop, Framework is a game-changer. It\u2019s awesome to know you can have a laptop that you can tweak and upgrade as you need, rather than being stuck with whatever you bought.\n\nThere are really two types of laptop users: those who get a new one every 2-3 years and those who invest in something that\u2019ll last. I\u2019m definitely in the latter camp. I used a MacBook Pro from 2017 until 2022, and while it served me well, it became unusable due to battery issues. The cost to replace the battery was so high that buying a new laptop seemed like a better option. That\u2019s where Framework comes in\u2014if they can keep delivering reasonably priced upgrades, they might just be the future we\u2019ve all been waiting for.\n\nI wish the video had taken a closer look at how Framework is delivering on its promises.

On top of it having a far worse screen and not being able to upgrade the CPU at all in the future. A similar Lenovo 14 G7 from Amazon is a good bit cheaper at $750 but again you're getting a basic 1920x1200 60hz screen and slower cpu. You can't even find a laptop like the framework you built (4.9GHz), that's the benefit as well, getting exactly what you want instead of compromising on a port, screen resolution, screen refresh rate, etc. Also comparing it to a laptop with half the RAM and Storage is completely disingenuous, since Apple has made it standard for these to be an insane upcharge when they shouldn't be. Getting a laptop with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of Storage from Best Buy leads you to about a $750 laptop as well, not $450. This laptop also is equipped with a 1920x1200 screen and a 60hz display, a similar albeit it newer ryzen 5 8645HS CPU, but it's hard to find a laptop with a 120hz screen that isn't a gaming laptop with a full GPU, so it's hard to find an apples to apples comparison.",

Combine that with the fact that if you don't a big lot of CPUs you get a shitty deal on price. Combine that with if you don't sell within volume you don't get quick access to the latest products.

This gives an indication as to what I can expect in future\u2026that\u2019s a bargain!!  Plus, as Framework grows in popularity, economies of scale should push the price down.\n\nSecondly, when you upgrade your motherboard, you can repurpose your old motherboard eg as a server and there are free downloadable 3D printer case designs for Framework motherboards. \n\nTherefore, upon upgrading I get TWO computers not one new one\u2026you need to add in the price of a free secondhand computer/server into the equation.\n\nThirdly, computers break..it\u2019s a fact of life and the cost of repair is negligible with Framework compared to any other brand\u2026and some brands are impossible to repair which means you have to replace the ENTIRE LAPTOP.  This huge cost is missing from his analysis.\n\nFourthly, he doesn\u2019t properly factor the value of recycling and waste prevention\u2026he\u2019s just another mindless consumer who moans about the environment but does nothing about it even when the solution is in his hands.  The cognitive dissonance is palpable but he dismisses it. \n\nLastly, as a Linux user, it\u2019s fantastic to have a brand that\u2019s put support of Linux as a primary goal.",

Being able to upgrade is great. Until it is the best option compared to the competition, with all other things being equal, it will continue to be a hard sell. Props to Framework for being one of the first to offer what enthusiasts have been asking for, just hopefully eventually they're able to get to a future where they can price in line with other manufacturers, and hopefully other manufacturers follow suit with this model as well. That's what we as consumers should be pushing for.",

The point is, if you want new ram, storage, CPU, display, your trackpad breaks, wifi chip malfunctions, keyboard loses keys, you can just get new ones and replace it! that is incredible. Im just a poor grad student and cant get one right now, ill stick to my XPS until the money starts flowing, but if you are looking for a new laptop and can afford something like an XPS, I would get the framework.

            "content": "Personally, I don't think Framework is for \"hardcore enthusiast\", as Austin has claimed. \nI am not a computer enthusiast, and I love my framework. Here is my criteria for a good laptop:\n\n- I only do very light computing task on my laptop, and I want good battery life, so U chip is actually an advantage for me, compare to the HS chip.\n- I want my laptop to have minimal environmental impact. It should be long-lasting and produces minimal e-wastes.\n- I want my laptop to have excellent Linux support, since I do not enjoy tinkering with my computers (happy to say, never `demsg`ed on my framework!)\n- I want a knowledgeable support community that actually knows about computers, so that if anything actually failed, I know I can resolve it in a couple of days at most.\n- I want long-term and easy firmware update for security. \n- If possible, I would prefer a nice screen.\n\nI think my requirement embodies basically what \"non-enthusiast\" wants: \"just works\", good battery life, great support, basic security, and climate conscious. And this basically rules out most laptops out there. Most major laptop brands like Dell, HP and Lenovo all have terrible phone tree, and good luck finding anyone that actually knows what they are doing. Many of them also don't support automatic firmware update. I am not going to search for the firmware and flash it every month, that is simply not what a \"non-enthusiast\" would do.\nIn the end, the only manufactures that come close to framework are system76 and tuxedo. I eventually chose framework because of its nice 3:2 display, the upgradable CPU, and the U instead of HS processor.\n\nQuite ironically, I believe Austin dislikes the framework precisely because he is an \"enthusiast\", he knows the performance differences between every laptop, and their value propositions. I personally would much prefer to not waste time in a phone tree or go on to dell forum, just to know that they are not able to fix my issue blah blah blah. With a framework, you know that all the hardware will work on Linux, with long-term support; and if anything fails, there is a huge and knowledgeable community that can help me fix it quickly.\n\nThe fact that Apple is one of the largest laptop manufacture, before their ARM transition, is a clear signal that consumers, especially non-enthusiasts like me, prefers a computer that works, instead of min-maxing on all the values on a laptop that will not be supported after a year. And I think that is the main target audiences of Framework.",

For that price and the cost for upgrading the parts is similar to just buy a new laptop, No CHANCE, even with the argument \"framework is for the enthusiast and the repairability is up on the roof\", it'll be a REASONABLE device/laptop to purchase, in terms of price to performance (lets face it, this is still important for everyone). All the problem here is in the price, i mean Framework is still considered new after all. I think it just needs time. \n\nBUT if they really want this product to NOT compete with a greater market (a market where people use laptop for work, including designing, editing, etc.), facing ASUS, LENOVO, etc. and they 100% focused for the enthusiast and tech fans (and/or developers, engineers), then yeah, putting a high price on that advantage and the uniqueness of that product is super ACCEPTABLE.",

But I would have liked to see some effort into diving into the ethos of the company's product (laptop) he is reviewing on, and who the actual audience for that is. They market their laptop for everyone because even if one didn't intend to have a laptop that lasts, and reduce E-waste, they would be contributing towards a better cause while also getting an okay system, and now the tech has evolved over the years - having an Okay system is all most people need including the average joe. Students, not so much like me :)\n (I am really tempted though)\n\nThe point of having that CPU upgrade is not so you can buy it every 6 months to be up to date, but to have a new system 4 years down the line to a higher spec, without adjusting to a new laptop with their own bios system, instabilities and quirks. If I own a car, I want to Own that and not be thinking like replacing the whole thing because something is cheaper to buy as a whole then just maintaining it - economics sense? ye maybe but you have to again adjust to it, get your muscle memory build over time. Besides the goal of Framework is entirely different from the market and they even standing close to competing, and desirable I might add? It is just awesome to be a part of it.\n\nApple ffs have been doing this since forever, people justifying the prices saying, it's for R&D, the software upgrade, the consistency and they all but given us laptops with no ports, keyboards that breaks, display that dies for no user error AT ALL. People still backed that up because of familiarity and the software ecosystem unison with their hardware (dongles and whatever but it works as the user expects) but then again, they were also being held hostage by that same company.\n\nWhatever framework is doing is by choice, the pricing is by choice while also trying their best to price for the competition despite being a low volume manufacturer. And the users are trying prop them up to have that ecosystem last and prosper till it becomes a no brainer to stick to framework and just wait for a newer hardware that just makes sense to upgrade.\n\nI didn't even mention about the saying the environment thing because frankly most people cannot justify buying specifically for that cause only because most can't afford that premium. If that was the case, then it would make sense for framework to never upgrade their hardware design and just bulk order just the motherboard and have that be updated every 6 months. And that is just as sad as buying a whole new laptop imo, because that ain't really solving the core cause either.",

I love my framework but it definitely does have problems that I'd like to see someone talk about. That said this review really missed the mark there. I took my laptop from a 4 core 11th gen i5 to a ryzen 7 7840u while I got to keep using the rest of the machine that I still liked. I was able to turn that old main board into a server and use my thin and light laptop to play triple a games at friends houses months after it struggled with some indie stuff. It's not the cheapest thing out there but I'd rather pay more for a system that is not only meant to last, but is also coming from a company with a strong environmental focus. All of the packaging is recyclable. Not getting a brand new laptop every few years means less batteries that I have to take care of to get new tech. Yes the fans are annoying and I would like to see them improved. I'd love to see a touch screen option come out, and it's a bit annoying how long it can take for upgrades to come out, but to me it's worth it for a one of a kind laptop that I feel good about buying, using, and not having to worry about. The hinges on my laptop got loose over time, and for $20 and 15 minutes of my time that is fixed, which you really can't do with any other laptop out there. Framework has problems, but the pros outweigh the cons to their target audience, so next time just please try and see it from our perspective.",

Sure, you might upgrade your laptop every year or two, but good luck getting a new battery or replacing a broken USB port on most mainstream laptops. With Framework, those issues are a non-issue.\n\nI\u2019m not even going to get started on companies like Dell with their awful design choices\u2014two Type-C ports only? Seriously? And if you want more RAM, you have to buy the higher storage model, which just hikes up the cost. Comparing the 'cheapest' orange to the 'cheapest' apple (fruit, not the company) is just plain wrong. They\u2019re in completely different categories.\n\nYes, the Framework might seem expensive, but that\u2019s partly because they\u2019re still growing and don\u2019t have the massive market share to negotiate lower component prices. But here\u2019s the thing\u2014with Framework, you have the freedom to shop around for cheaper SSDs and RAM, and upgrade your laptop the way *you* want, without being locked into overpriced 'upgrade' options.",

While I am happy to see you having a look, you are looking at the Framework laptop like it is just another laptop and not giving the proper spotlight it deserves. \n\nThe laptop is a different kind of laptop that aims for longevity, repairability and upgradability. You can swap out a lot of parts (the main board, the RAM, storage, even the battery) and even upgrade them (For example, I am planning to swap from a 11th Gen Intel to the AMD board). You dont show updraging the board. \n\nThe new screen's rounded corners are indeed a drawback, but looks minor to me. Thing is they either had the choice to get a squared cornered screen but make it more expensive or go with that pre made model for cheaper, and the latter was the selected choice. Blame bigger companies for making this design popular. \n\nTo me, having a laptop being repairable AND upgradeable is something I love, even if I have to sacrifice some things.\n\nI hope you can remake this review to shows the potential it has rather than comparing it to another laptop for performance and price, because that is not what Framework is about. They are rebuilding the path that bigger companies have abandoned for years.",

Framework is a great company doing a great thing, but it's going to take some time for the price/performance ratio to improve before the average consumer is going to care.",

Instead, they\u2019re focused on giving us a laptop that lasts\u2014a device you can upgrade over time without breaking the bank.\n\nIn a world where replacing a screen on a $500 laptop can cost almost half of its value, or where a tiny issue with soldered components means tossing the whole laptop, Framework is a game-changer. It\u2019s awesome to know you can have a laptop that you can tweak and upgrade as you need, rather than being stuck with whatever you bought.\n\nThere are really two types of laptop users: those who get a new one every 2-3 years and those who invest in something that\u2019ll last. I\u2019m definitely in the latter camp. I used a MacBook Pro from 2017 until 2022, and while it served me well, it became unusable due to battery issues. The cost to replace the battery was so high that buying a new laptop seemed like a better option. That\u2019s where Framework comes in\u2014if they can keep delivering reasonably priced upgrades, they might just be the future we\u2019ve all been waiting for.\n\nI wish the video had taken a closer look at how Framework is delivering on its promises. The only way they can compete with the big brands is if more people get on board, and negative reviews might scare off those who are curious about trying something new.",

A similar Lenovo 14 G7 from Amazon is a good bit cheaper at $750 but again you're getting a basic 1920x1200 60hz screen and slower cpu. You can't even find a laptop like the framework you built (4.9GHz), that's the benefit as well, getting exactly what you want instead of compromising on a port, screen resolution, screen refresh rate, etc. Also comparing it to a laptop with half the RAM and Storage is completely disingenuous, since Apple has made it standard for these to be an insane upcharge when they shouldn't be. Getting a laptop with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of Storage from Best Buy leads you to about a $750 laptop as well, not $450. This laptop also is equipped with a 1920x1200 screen and a 60hz display, a similar albeit it newer ryzen 5 8645HS CPU, but it's hard to find a laptop with a 120hz screen that isn't a gaming laptop with a full GPU, so it's hard to find an apples to apples comparison.",

He tries to pin Framework as a system that has to be sold to the open consumer market at BB and other establishments but fails to forget that this brand is mostly aimed to the audience who wants control on what can be done with their system now and in the future.\nHe is making lots of points to show that this is great for a laptop but hates the higher price tag, but just tries to push against it like it needs to step up.\nI would rather side with the Framework group and allowing a few fans in their systems than the tiny single fan that HP tries to push on the masses.\nThanks Austin for giving Framework the spotlight it deserves instead of dragging it down because of Linus.",

            "content": "Agree with the premise that Framework laptops aren\u2019t for everyday consumers, but think the video didn\u2019t try to understand what customer / scenario might a Framework be a good option. For example:\n\n- Most countries don\u2019t get the crazy sales the US have, where you can get a well-built laptop like the Yoga 7 for US$500. They usually go for US$900-1000 up here in Canada (worse in other markets), so $1200 for a Framework doesn\u2019t sound that outrageous at all. \n\n- Many Framework customers, who are probably somewhat tech literate, aren\u2019t buying the RAM, SSD, chargers, etc with Framework \u2014 but are instead getting them cheaper through other retailers when there\u2019s a sale, getting them used, etc.\n\n- As someone who helped with managing IT in a small business before, the fact that you can obtain Framework parts easily on their website is attractive for maintaining the company\u2019s fleet of laptops. Other manufacturers just don\u2019t make parts available except to corporate customers who have huge IT departments. \n\n- In terms of customization, being able to customize the ports and the keyboard layout / language is hugely convenient. If you type in multiple languages, the only other manufacturer that offers alternative keyboard options is Apple.\n\n- For an ultrabook, where you\u2019re realistically doing office work or some light photo / video editing, having the latest processor doesn\u2019t matter that much? 12th-14th Intel all share the same architecture with some minor spec bump, for example\u2026\n\n- Lastly, I really don\u2019t get the comparison with custom keyboards. The customer who wants a complete laptop for $500 are probably buy $20 keyboards\u2026not the insane custom keyboards this channel often features\u2026",

I can code, do some light gaming (actually, pretty much anything the steam deck can do this can do also) swap out ssds for different osses (something I do since windows gets more battery life than Linux), and just about anything that any other laptop can. I think the thing Austin is losing sight of and not stressing enough is that you can UPGRADE the mobo he\u2019s complaining about. With that said\u2026 I do think prices for the ryzen variant should go down. It has been a while. But then again, the new ones aren\u2019t out. And also, you\u2019re not going to be needing the latest and greatest all the time, especially on a laptop since most of the time, you wouldn\u2019t be able to go hardcore with it anyway. It\u2019s for when down the line, a new processor comes out and it makes a noticeable enough improvement that swapping it makes sense. And you can\u2019t do that with anything that costs less than this laptop (or more if you consider the MacBook honestly).\n\nI\u2019m not gonna go and tell everyone to buy the framework laptop.

Even though I'm not a heavy duty user and mainly use it at home. Warranty repair denied claiming its due to physical damage (no it's not). Paying for the repair from my pocket, which requires replacing the entire screen section, would cost 70% of the original purchase cost.\n\nLooking around I could hardly find any matte 2,8K display laptops on the market where I live and I'm aiming for that due to switching to Linux and needing a display without fractional scaling. The only other options I was able to find are a couple of Lenovos - Ideapad Pros and Yoga 7 Slims - priced between $1100-1400. Or some Lenovo T14s around $2200. Compared to these the Framework is not a bad deal at all, especially factoring in the repairability.\n\nThe only valid downside I agree with is the rounded corners on the screen offered only with squared bezels. I mean it just seems so straightforward to create bezels with the same rounded corners around the edges that I can't even fathom why Framework hasn't been doing it.",

This gives an indication as to what I can expect in future\u2026that\u2019s a bargain!!  Plus, as Framework grows in popularity, economies of scale should push the price down.\n\nSecondly, when you upgrade your motherboard, you can repurpose your old motherboard eg as a server and there are free downloadable 3D printer case designs for Framework motherboards. \n\nTherefore, upon upgrading I get TWO computers not one new one\u2026you need to add in the price of a free secondhand computer/server into the equation.\n\nThirdly, computers break..it\u2019s a fact of life and the cost of repair is negligible with Framework compared to any other brand\u2026and some brands are impossible to repair which means you have to replace the ENTIRE LAPTOP.  This huge cost is missing from his analysis.\n\nFourthly, he doesn\u2019t properly factor the value of recycling and waste prevention\u2026he\u2019s just another mindless consumer who moans about the environment but does nothing about it even when the solution is in his hands.  The cognitive dissonance is palpable but he dismisses it. \n\nLastly, as a Linux user, it\u2019s fantastic to have a brand that\u2019s put support of Linux as a primary goal.",

Props to Framework for being one of the first to offer what enthusiasts have been asking for, just hopefully eventually they're able to get to a future where they can price in line with other manufacturers, and hopefully other manufacturers follow suit with this model as well.

In my short time in IT, I've had to send too many devices in for repair that I could have fixed in 5 minutes if the RAM or storage wasn't soldered. In 5 years when I'm ready for a CPU or GPU upgrade, I can spend $500-$600 on upgrades instead of an entirely new device.

That yoga is almost entirely irreparable too. You break anything on it and it's essentially waste.\n\nIn my eyes, you buy the initial unit for 300 more, upgrade two years later like you likely would for the yoga at ~$400 like you mentioned, and you've already broken even.

            "content": "Personally, I don't think Framework is for \"hardcore enthusiast\", as Austin has claimed. \nI am not a computer enthusiast, and I love my framework. Here is my criteria for a good laptop:\n\n- I only do very light computing task on my laptop, and I want good battery life, so U chip is actually an advantage for me, compare to the HS chip.\n- I want my laptop to have minimal environmental impact. It should be long-lasting and produces minimal e-wastes.\n- I want my laptop to have excellent Linux support, since I do not enjoy tinkering with my computers (happy to say, never `demsg`ed on my framework!)\n- I want a knowledgeable support community that actually knows about computers, so that if anything actually failed, I know I can resolve it in a couple of days at most.\n- I want long-term and easy firmware update for security. \n- If possible, I would prefer a nice screen.\n\nI think my requirement embodies basically what \"non-enthusiast\" wants: \"just works\", good battery life, great support, basic security, and climate conscious. And this basically rules out most laptops out there. Most major laptop brands like Dell, HP and Lenovo all have terrible phone tree, and good luck finding anyone that actually knows what they are doing. Many of them also don't support automatic firmware update. I am not going to search for the firmware and flash it every month, that is simply not what a \"non-enthusiast\" would do.\nIn the end, the only manufactures that come close to framework are system76 and tuxedo. I eventually chose framework because of its nice 3:2 display, the upgradable CPU, and the U instead of HS processor.\n\nQuite ironically, I believe Austin dislikes the framework precisely because he is an \"enthusiast\", he knows the performance differences between every laptop, and their value propositions. I personally would much prefer to not waste time in a phone tree or go on to dell forum, just to know that they are not able to fix my issue blah blah blah. With a framework, you know that all the hardware will work on Linux, with long-term support; and if anything fails, there is a huge and knowledgeable community that can help me fix it quickly.\n\nThe fact that Apple is one of the largest laptop manufacture, before their ARM transition, is a clear signal that consumers, especially non-enthusiasts like me, prefers a computer that works, instead of min-maxing on all the values on a laptop that will not be supported after a year. And I think that is the main target audiences of Framework.",

Hoewever, if you are a large company like HP, you may be buying 500,000 and AMD might be selling them for $75 each (all numbers made up since I'm not a parts buyer for a large company...). Now extrapolate that out to every single part in the laptop plus research, design, marketing, etc. and of course you'll be paying a premium for a smaller company's product. It comes down to is it worth it to you to support that company and their goals. Who knows maybe in the future Framework will be a powerhouse and be more price comparable to a big brand or maybe they go broke....

I think it just needs time. \n\nBUT if they really want this product to NOT compete with a greater market (a market where people use laptop for work, including designing, editing, etc.), facing ASUS, LENOVO, etc. and they 100% focused for the enthusiast and tech fans (and/or developers, engineers), then yeah, putting a high price on that advantage and the uniqueness of that product is super ACCEPTABLE.",

            "content": "Austin's take was solely in respect to the market the most average joe would face and that's completely fine take, that is HIS audience. But I would have liked to see some effort into diving into the ethos of the company's product (laptop) he is reviewing on, and who the actual audience for that is. They market their laptop for everyone because even if one didn't intend to have a laptop that lasts, and reduce E-waste, they would be contributing towards a better cause while also getting an okay system, and now the tech has evolved over the years - having an Okay system is all most people need including the average joe. Students, not so much like me :)\n (I am really tempted though)\n\nThe point of having that CPU upgrade is not so you can buy it every 6 months to be up to date, but to have a new system 4 years down the line to a higher spec, without adjusting to a new laptop with their own bios system, instabilities and quirks. If I own a car, I want to Own that and not be thinking like replacing the whole thing because something is cheaper to buy as a whole then just maintaining it - economics sense? ye maybe but you have to again adjust to it, get your muscle memory build over time. Besides the goal of Framework is entirely different from the market and they even standing close to competing, and desirable I might add? It is just awesome to be a part of it.\n\nApple ffs have been doing this since forever, people justifying the prices saying, it's for R&D, the software upgrade, the consistency and they all but given us laptops with no ports, keyboards that breaks, display that dies for no user error AT ALL. People still backed that up because of familiarity and the software ecosystem unison with their hardware (dongles and whatever but it works as the user expects) but then again, they were also being held hostage by that same company.\n\nWhatever framework is doing is by choice, the pricing is by choice while also trying their best to price for the competition despite being a low volume manufacturer. And the users are trying prop them up to have that ecosystem last and prosper till it becomes a no brainer to stick to framework and just wait for a newer hardware that just makes sense to upgrade.\n\nI didn't even mention about the saying the environment thing because frankly most people cannot justify buying specifically for that cause only because most can't afford that premium. If that was the case, then it would make sense for framework to never upgrade their hardware design and just bulk order just the motherboard and have that be updated every 6 months. And that is just as sad as buying a whole new laptop imo, because that ain't really solving the core cause either.",

I love my framework but it definitely does have problems that I'd like to see someone talk about. That said this review really missed the mark there. I took my laptop from a 4 core 11th gen i5 to a ryzen 7 7840u while I got to keep using the rest of the machine that I still liked. I was able to turn that old main board into a server and use my thin and light laptop to play triple a games at friends houses months after it struggled with some indie stuff. It's not the cheapest thing out there but I'd rather pay more for a system that is not only meant to last, but is also coming from a company with a strong environmental focus. All of the packaging is recyclable. Not getting a brand new laptop every few years means less batteries that I have to take care of to get new tech. Yes the fans are annoying and I would like to see them improved. I'd love to see a touch screen option come out, and it's a bit annoying how long it can take for upgrades to come out, but to me it's worth it for a one of a kind laptop that I feel good about buying, using, and not having to worry about. The hinges on my laptop got loose over time, and for $20 and 15 minutes of my time that is fixed, which you really can't do with any other laptop out there. Framework has problems, but the pros outweigh the cons to their target audience, so next time just please try and see it from our perspective.",

Sure, you might upgrade your laptop every year or two, but good luck getting a new battery or replacing a broken USB port on most mainstream laptops.

And if you want more RAM, you have to buy the higher storage model, which just hikes up the cost. Comparing the 'cheapest' orange to the 'cheapest' apple (fruit, not the company) is just plain wrong. They\u2019re in completely different categories.\n\nYes, the Framework might seem expensive, but that\u2019s partly because they\u2019re still growing and don\u2019t have the massive market share to negotiate lower component prices.

            "content": "This review is fundamentally flawed. While I am happy to see you having a look, you are looking at the Framework laptop like it is just another laptop and not giving the proper spotlight it deserves. \n\nThe laptop is a different kind of laptop that aims for longevity, repairability and upgradability. You can swap out a lot of parts (the main board, the RAM, storage, even the battery) and even upgrade them (For example, I am planning to swap from a 11th Gen Intel to the AMD board). You dont show updraging the board. \n\nThe new screen's rounded corners are indeed a drawback, but looks minor to me. Thing is they either had the choice to get a squared cornered screen but make it more expensive or go with that pre made model for cheaper, and the latter was the selected choice. Blame bigger companies for making this design popular. \n\nTo me, having a laptop being repairable AND upgradeable is something I love, even if I have to sacrifice some things.\n\nI hope you can remake this review to shows the potential it has rather than comparing it to another laptop for performance and price, because that is not what Framework is about. They are rebuilding the path that bigger companies have abandoned for years.",

I feel very as though the view taken here was very skewed to which I can say I am very disappointed, but I still look forward to future videos.",

One thing I totally disagree with is his comment on it feeling \"cheap.\" I have a 1st batch of the original Intel 11th gen Framework 13, so I can't be totally sure if something's changed, but the only laptop that either of mine (I also have a Framework 16) feel \"cheap\" compared to is one of the newer 14 inch MacBook Pros, which have about the worst specs for the money of literally any laptop you can buy.

This is not made clear on the website but the price that was shown in the video for the DIY Version does not inclued all the neccessary parts while the predbuild version does. If you get the DIY Version you should get your own RAM, storage and OS as Framework charges a significant premium for these. The price difference actually makes sense because they have to build all laptops for quality control. The DIY versions are actually disassembled after that so they require more work. \n\nAlso the value of these laptops is not in the specs but in the repairebility and upgradebility. If you want the most perfomance per dollar this is simply not the laptop for you. There are tons of options that offer these. But there is bearely any (if any at all) other laptops that do offer what the framework does. And there are a lot of people that value repairibility an upgradebility over pure performance. There are already some manufactures that implement more rapairible designs in their laptops but as far as i know none of them go as far as framework with the concept. Right now they still offer a very unique product.\n\nI know that Austin did mention some of my points but his overall conclusion was a more negative than what i think framework deserves.",

Instead, they\u2019re focused on giving us a laptop that lasts\u2014a device you can upgrade over time without breaking the bank.\n\nIn a world where replacing a screen on a $500 laptop can cost almost half of its value, or where a tiny issue with soldered components means tossing the whole laptop, Framework is a game-changer. It\u2019s awesome to know you can have a laptop that you can tweak and upgrade as you need, rather than being stuck with whatever you bought.\n\nThere are really two types of laptop users: those who get a new one every 2-3 years and those who invest in something that\u2019ll last. I\u2019m definitely in the latter camp. I used a MacBook Pro from 2017 until 2022, and while it served me well, it became unusable due to battery issues. The cost to replace the battery was so high that buying a new laptop seemed like a better option. That\u2019s where Framework comes in\u2014if they can keep delivering reasonably priced upgrades, they might just be the future we\u2019ve all been waiting for.\n\nI wish the video had taken a closer look at how Framework is delivering on its promises. The only way they can compete with the big brands is if more people get on board, and negative reviews might scare off those who are curious about trying something new.",

So using a cheap laptop as alternative is not too fair.  3. People needs to stay on relatively new CPUs.  For example, developers, editors, etc.?   So instead of getting new laptops, they only need to switch out parts and no need to get used to with a new laptop layout (I hate manufactures never keep the same keyboard layout).    Framework is not for me because I don't swap laptop often enough.  My main daily machine is an 8 year old desktop.  However, I do like their concept.  One of these day, I may snap an older framework board and use as a behind monitor computer (my concept of better AIO).

Getting a laptop with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of Storage from Best Buy leads you to about a $750 laptop as well, not $450.

He tries to pin Framework as a system that has to be sold to the open consumer market at BB and other establishments but fails to forget that this brand is mostly aimed to the audience who wants control on what can be done with their system now and in the future.\nHe is making lots of points to show that this is great for a laptop but hates the higher price tag, but just tries to push against it like it needs to step up.\nI would rather side with the Framework group and allowing a few fans in their systems than the tiny single fan that HP tries to push on the masses.\nThanks Austin for giving Framework the spotlight it deserves instead of dragging it down because of Linus.",

For example:\n\n- Most countries don\u2019t get the crazy sales the US have, where you can get a well-built laptop like the Yoga 7 for US$500. They usually go for US$900-1000 up here in Canada (worse in other markets), so $1200 for a Framework doesn\u2019t sound that outrageous at all. \n\n- Many Framework customers, who are probably somewhat tech literate, aren\u2019t buying the RAM, SSD, chargers, etc with Framework \u2014 but are instead getting them cheaper through other retailers when there\u2019s a sale, getting them used, etc.\n\n- As someone who helped with managing IT in a small business before, the fact that you can obtain Framework parts easily on their website is attractive for maintaining the company\u2019s fleet of laptops. Other manufacturers just don\u2019t make parts available except to corporate customers who have huge IT departments. \n\n- In terms of customization, being able to customize the ports and the keyboard layout / language is hugely convenient. If you type in multiple languages, the only other manufacturer that offers alternative keyboard options is Apple.\n\n- For an ultrabook, where you\u2019re realistically doing office work or some light photo / video editing, having the latest processor doesn\u2019t matter that much? 12th-14th Intel all share the same architecture with some minor spec bump, for example\u2026\n\n- Lastly, I really don\u2019t get the comparison with custom keyboards. The customer who wants a complete laptop for $500 are probably buy $20 keyboards\u2026not the insane custom keyboards this channel often features\u2026",

Combine that with the fact that if you don't a big lot of CPUs you get a shitty deal on price. Combine that with if you don't sell within volume you don't get quick access to the latest products. Combine with the fact that AMD tend to focus on Desktop, Console and Server (aka their moneymakers) their little amount of laptop chips they bother to make. Combine that with the fact that Qualcomm is most likely only seeding CPUs with top laptop maker, which Framework isn't, mean no Qualcomm framework laptop, but hey they did show off a RISC-V motherboard so ARM-based linux laptop maybe. \n\nBut yea, Framework mission and goal are really align with how the industry run which causes Framework to be pricy and a bit behind; and to make matter worst if behind don't buy their laptop, they'll never be price competitive with Tier 1 unless they cost corners",

I think the thing Austin is losing sight of and not stressing enough is that you can UPGRADE the mobo he\u2019s complaining about. With that said\u2026 I do think prices for the ryzen variant should go down. It has been a while. But then again, the new ones aren\u2019t out.

It\u2019s for when down the line, a new processor comes out and it makes a noticeable enough improvement that swapping it makes sense.

        "1,5 years ago I decided in favor of buying a Yoga 7. Now I have multiple cracks on the plastic bezel around the screen and the plastic is shattered around both hinges. Even though I'm not a heavy duty user and mainly use it at home. Warranty repair denied claiming its due to physical damage (no it's not). Paying for the repair from my pocket, which requires replacing the entire screen section, would cost 70% of the original purchase cost.\n\nLooking around I could hardly find any matte 2,8K display laptops on the market where I live and I'm aiming for that due to switching to Linux and needing a display without fractional scaling. The only other options I was able to find are a couple of Lenovos - Ideapad Pros and Yoga 7 Slims - priced between $1100-1400. Or some Lenovo T14s around $2200. Compared to these the Framework is not a bad deal at all, especially factoring in the repairability.\n\nThe only valid downside I agree with is the rounded corners on the screen offered only with squared bezels. I mean it just seems so straightforward to create bezels with the same rounded corners around the edges that I can't even fathom why Framework hasn't been doing it.",
        "I came to this video thanks to a LTT video when people asked Linus to react to you (and he give you the reason), I agree, Framework laptops are very expensive and I suppose that is not their fault, as you say, they\u2019re a small company and that makes difficult to negotiate better prices for the components, it would be great if they grow as a company and bring better prices.",
        "My mom bought one kislux  and she loves it. It had been there for over 10 years when she went out with it.",
        "Yeah, they cost more than others. But surely we should be trying to support companies who are trying to support us.",
        "He\u2019s ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, so why have I paid my final payment for the even more expensive Intel Core Ultra version?\n\nIt\u2019s because he underestimates the true value proposition that the Framework 13 offers.\n\nFirstly, he\u2019s misunderstood the true cost: all he talks about is the upfront cost, when it\u2019s the savings on upgrade that redress the balance. \n\nE.g. to upgrade to the Ryzen 5 motherboard in his video it costs just $419.  This gives an indication as to what I can expect in future\u2026that\u2019s a bargain!!  Plus, as Framework grows in popularity, economies of scale should push the price down.\n\nSecondly, when you upgrade your motherboard, you can repurpose your old motherboard eg as a server and there are free downloadable 3D printer case designs for Framework motherboards. \n\nTherefore, upon upgrading I get TWO computers not one new one\u2026you need to add in the price of a free secondhand computer/server into the equation.\n\nThirdly, computers break..it\u2019s a fact of life and the cost of repair is negligible with Framework compared to any other brand\u2026and some brands are impossible to repair which means you have to replace the ENTIRE LAPTOP.  This huge cost is missing from his analysis.\n\nFourthly, he doesn\u2019t properly factor the value of recycling and waste prevention\u2026he\u2019s just another mindless consumer who moans about the environment but does nothing about it even when the solution is in his hands.  The cognitive dissonance is palpable but he dismisses it. \n\nLastly, as a Linux user, it\u2019s fantastic to have a brand that\u2019s put support of Linux as a primary goal."

Maybe Darrin could potentially be Garrett Schmidt and he\u2019s about to become the Puppet? It would be a good set-up for later when Mike finds out that his brother isn\u2019t just deceased, but Afton has his soul trapped within one of the animatronics.",

            "content": "Script 4 makes the most sense with the given evidence we have so far, FNAF 2 is the only in game OG location we see with a carousel in it. The location is also referred to as \u201cabandoned\u201d in the script title. Unlike FNAF 2\u2019s location which looks relatively new and a functioning business, however FNAF 2 is also a prequel to the first game, but the next movie can\u2019t be a prequel since it is already confirmed to be set after the first film, with Josh Hutcherson returning so unless he magically gets de-aged I can\u2019t see the new movie being set in the past, so basically having 2 or more abandoned Freddy\u2019s locations makes sense in this timeline. \nAlso regarding the \u201cGemma\u201d and \u201cDarrin\u201d names it\u2019s common for screenwriters to use an anonym when writing a character who\u2019s identity is not meant to be revealed at the time, and especially since this is Scott who we are talking about who loves his secrets and red herrings. \nScott is another reason why I\u2019m leaning to script 4 because as much as I like script 3 I just don\u2019t believe Scott would reveal what seems like a very critical part of the movie in a script preview, think about all the tiny details in the games he goes so far to hide and have us theorize about. It just doesn\u2019t seem like him to reveal something this way, that\u2019s never been his style.\nSo I\u2019m pretty confident that script 4 is our winner.",

And also Vanessa said that she loved the place when she was a kid, and when she introduced Mike to the animatronics, you can see how much joy she was having, as if she had a passion towards them.",

For anyone who may not fully understand the page numbering system in contrast with the film, a good rule of thumb is that every page = 1 minute of screen time. So that would mean with the toy chica page, that whole thing would've happened loosely 25 minutes into the film, which would be absolutely insane in my opinion. Honestly, either of the last two seem pretty plausible, but I think most likely it'll be the third one, regarding how much it doesn't reveal about the plot plus the page number, but the last one could totally work as well!!",

            "content": "Film student here! Typically, when it comes to scripts, a general rule of thumb is one page of a script equals 1 minute in the final film, so if we're looking at the pages from a story perspective, placing them into a cohesive story... I'd say either the 3rd or 4th one flow the best, not saying that the others aren't likely either... but they do flow the best. \n\nFor the 3rd one, Mike burning plushies in sort of a co-op mission could lead to a climax and resolution at the end of the film given it's page 58, making it around an hour mark would leave enough time for a resolution. \n\nSimilar reasoning for the 4th one, this sequence would be early on in the film... possibly being an event from the past, which would then connect somehow to something later in the movie. \n\nThe reason I don't think the 1st one is likely is because based on where Vanessa was left off in the first film, how likely is it that she's out of the hospital... there could be a time jump, perhaps she was watching Abby and they were kidnapped by an animatronic... but the suspense in the scene just seems too much for what would be the half hour mark in what will probably be close to a 2 hour film. \n\nAs for the 2nd one... it's just a bit much in all honesty. This scene seems what is typically exposition, giving the audience some backstory... and it's just unusual to place this in 20 minutes in. Then again, this is Scott we're talking about... and perhaps we meet these characters earlier in the film... but I can't imagine an event taking place that would even involve the US Government with Fazbear Entertainment this early on, if at all in the franchise. \n\nI'm honestly happy to talk more about this too, disecting scripts is essentially what I study at school... ha!!",

            "content": "Hii, I'm a film graduate and I have some thoughts. This will be a LONG text (1114 words lol) explaining my opinion and I apologize if there's smth hard to understand (English isn't my first language) but, in a nutshell, I think the fourth and last script is the real one bc, from a narrative standpoint, it would make a good start for the movie AND it's written correctly (although not having numbered scenes is infuriating but alas, none of the scenes in other scripts are numbered, so maybe it's a weird standard from US filming industry, idk). \n\nI also think that \"the man\" can't be (or at least shouldn't be) any important character unlike Darrin and Gemma. Why? Well, when you hand the script to the actors and actresses, they need to know the role they are playing, so hiding the identity of the character in a script that only the staff would read and that everyone working on it knows who the character is is unnecessary and even confusing. A script is meant to guide the actors and describe ONLY what is shown on the screen objectively. \n\nI agree that it's weird that a dad goes into an abandoned Freddy's and KNOWS his way around (if he didn't, he wouldn't have known that the carousel has a door that leads to a staircase and wouldn't enter it without second thoughts) so my guess is that he's an employee from Freddy's, like a technician or smth similar. As to why he'd be bringing his kids to an abandoned location? Idk, maybe William ordered him to do so (either by manipulation or intimidation) or some other reason. I can imagine lots of possibilities tbh, but we won't know until the movie comes out.\n\nBut why am I so sure it's the last one? Well, I'm not 100% sure bc the third one is also very plausible to be real, but feels weird that in minute 58 of the movie (as others said down here in the comments, the numbering system of a script is 1 page is 1 minute of the film) Mike is getting ready to kinda sneak in a guarded location, either FNAF 2 location with the toy animatronics or somewhere else. The standard length for a movie is between 1h 30 min and 2h and, assuming that the film will be at least 2h, this is happening right in the middle of the film, which feels weird bc there would be 1h more of action when this feels like the start of the climax of the movie, which actually would make a bit more sense if the movie was around 1h 30 min. However, knowing that the first movie was 1h 50 min, I HIGHLY doubt that this one will be shorter bc there's A LOT more material than in the first one (for starters, there are twice as many animatronics than in the first movie that have to be narratively presented and developed and the budget of the movie is clearly a lot higher, so there's no way it will be shorter). So yeah, the third one just feels weird timing-wise.\n\nAbout the second script... Well, I won't even touch the thing about remnant and government funding the pizzaplex BUT what definitively sent me off is that it's not written correctly. It might be considered nitpicking BUT as I said before, a script has to describe the actions seen on screen objectively, so the paragraph where the men and women at the table are \"obviously surprised to hear that blah blah blah\" is NOT an objective action. It's a description of the character's thought process and/or viewer interpretation and is a basic error in script writing. A script isn't a novel and has many rules concerning it's writing, and that's one of the basic ones that any of us film students granted us an F many times when we were starting to write scripts (I used to write novels, so I obviously learned this the hard way). Also, the annotations (the brief text under the name of the character's dialogue) are incorrect bc an annotation is an indication of the emotions or expressions that a character is doing like \"(looks distressed)\" or \"(in a sad tone)\" that are meant for the actor to understand the tone of the actions and dialogue they're doing. However, all the annotations in this script are actions like \"waving a hand\" or \"thumping the paper\", which are also written incorrectly bc ALL verbs have to be in a present tense, not in gerund bc those verbs are narrative, which I've already said that it's a no-go in script writing. So yeah, if this script is the real one, I'd be disappointed MAINLY bc that script is supposed to be written by a professional, and no professional should make such basic errors.\n\nFinally, about the first script, for starters my brain hurts while trying to understand how the action is being presented, so that says a lot. Again, it's written like if it was a novel, which I said it's a basic error, but, aside from that, the action described is weird by itself. From a timing standpoint, this happening 25 min in the movie is simply weird: it has no flow of action purpose, feels really forced and basically this should happen either at the start of the movie where the plot conflict is presented, at the start of the climax deepening the conflict (Vanessa and Abby are tricked by William/other antagonist to do smth through Toy Chica) or at the end of the movie where the conflict is solved with a weirdly happy ending that wouldn't suit this franchise at all. Also, from a lore standpoint, it feels off that Toy Chica, out of all Toy animatronics, can talk so fluidly bc I don't remember the Toy animatronics having a complex voice box. That actually would fit more to what I remember about the Funtimes with the voice luring system and stuff. However, as literally no one else called this out, not even Dawko, I'm going to assume that I have the animatronics all mixed up.\n\nSo that would be my reasoning as to why I think the last script would be the more fitting to be an actual movie script. I just wish they number the scenes bc oh boy not numbering them just makes filming REALLY complicated for everyone in the set, and I'm talking through experience. Also, if you've read all this to the end omg you are crazy and thank you so much, I hope this was as educational for you as it was infuriating to me lol",

Knowing that the fnaf 2 location did in fact have it's own killing (or at least is believed to be) from the fnaf 2 minigames, I think this makes a good motive for actually going there and having a goal rather than just being a night guard.\nMy theory is that in the movie universe, the toys are not haunted but will still attack them because they're quite literally criminals, breaking in and trying to set fire to the place. If there was an MCI, then Afton would've hid the bodies in the withereds since they're bigger than the toys and locked in parts and service. Or yk, have the toys also be haunted since they're made from the withereds. Either way it's interesting to think about",

As for the \"man\" it's going to be one of those \"telling of the beginning\" stories, like, the haunting movie called \"the Messengers\" I can see a starting of a horror story like this just laying out the story and 4th one seems to hit it on the dot. I could be wrong I just grew up watching a lot of scary movies and this seems like a crazy good scene so far.",

However, it feels like the first three pages would either be crammed with info, or just barren/vague and confuse people.\n\nThe other script with Mike and Abby talking about the \u201cplushies\u201d is probably referencing the story of the \u201cVelveteen Rabbit\u201d which I loved as a kid but am now disturbed by haha. The page number being in the 50\u2019s range tells me that it is in the middle of the script (industry standard script length for most movies is around 80-120 pages, and 1 page = 1 Minute), aka where our heroes do something that will trigger the start of the final act. \n\nMake what you will of this, Thanks for reading!\n\nP.s, tell Scott I'd love to write a spinoff book featuring Carlton from the silver eyes as a paranormal investigator, I feel like it would have potential and just makes sense ;)",

            "content": "I think- or at least I'd like to think- that the final one was the real deal. It's usually what you're taught when script-writing, but generally 1 page of a script is equal to 1 minute screen time. The first page is just absurd. So much goes on in that scene it would feel over the top. Same with the military script. \nThe page about the plushies is interesting however.\u00a0It would definitely make more sense with context, maybe it's referring to a discussion the characters have already had? If something is wrong with the toy animatronics why is it up to Mike, Abby and Vanessa to fix them?\nFinally, the last page.\u00a0I felt like it flowed much better too, and it was a good little opening considering its only page 4. But my theory is that this little secret room is a room William created, since it seemed well hidden and not behind any ordinary staff door. I think it could have been a place he used to kill, or tamper with the animatronics in a sneaky way.\u00a0\nThough god knows how this guy (I'm assuming he was a former worker) found out about it, and felt the need to bring his kids.\u00a0\nAlso, would it seem a bit repetitive that both films take place in an abandoned pizzeria? I'd like to think that it takes place whilst the pizzeria is still functioning, though that's unlikely....The more that I think about it, the more I believe the infected plushie script.",

With the third one, it feels like something that would happen, I think the only bit that wouldn't be in the script is \"We got a job to do\" but Abby talking about that story seems in character for her and lastly while I do love the idea Dawko put forward and I can see that being the case, I also think it could be that, the bit saying the building is abandoned is the red herring, as if you take the script and change it so that its after hours, it would make sense for a  employee to take their kids there after hours to look at the animatronics up close, could possibly be a previous night guard but it definitely feels like something that would happen in the opening of the film",

            "content": "My major worry is this movie is going a little too fast. I know that sounds insane after waiting eight years for the first movie, but hear me out here. The first movie was amazing, obviously, the props and animatronics were genuinely perfect. It was more just fantastic and wonderful and magical seeing this movie come to life before our eyes, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was without problems. The first Fnaf movie suffered from pacing and lack of horror. There were a lot of scenes that just kind of jumped back-and-forth between each other with no connective tissue, some characters seem to bland, even though they were complex, just because they didn\u2019t have enough screen time. And of course the lack of blood makes things frustrating. The springlocks scene could\u2019ve been so much better if we saw blood leaking out of the suit slowly. And obviously blood doesn\u2019t equal horror, so, having more shots of the animatronics stalking the protagonists from the background in the darkness is necessary, keep them creepy, elevating dread to another level. I am absolutely excited about this movie, I just really hope they learn from their mistakes with the first one and make the best thing they possibly can.",

It's also a reference too one of the failed concepts for the first movie that scott told us about. Something regarding the army using Fazbear technology in the military or something.\n\nPage 58: Def the 2nd most convincing one, however still probably fake. It seems like yet another reference to a failed concept, this one being the infamous \"plushies take manhattan\" pitch from years ago. Also Mike's line at the end doesn't seem in character for him. But your thoughts on the plushie story being an analogy is a very good point.\n\nPage 4: Makes the most sense. This seems like a cold open to the film establishing that there was more than one location in the timeline. And the vagueness of the context of the scene makes it seem like it's real. The line \"we're not here for a ride sweetie.\" shows a clear ulterior motive that would probably be set up in the next minutes of the script. Also it's the only one that references something from the actual fnaf 2 location and uses it as part of the story. Unlike page 25 which only references toy chica existing.",

Given Scott mention he loves sci-fi, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the government one was real, especially since it was a script concept he had for the first movie as well.

For anyone who may not fully understand the page numbering system in contrast with the film, a good rule of thumb is that every page = 1 minute of screen time.

            "content": "Script 4 makes the most sense with the given evidence we have so far, FNAF 2 is the only in game OG location we see with a carousel in it. The location is also referred to as \u201cabandoned\u201d in the script title. Unlike FNAF 2\u2019s location which looks relatively new and a functioning business, however FNAF 2 is also a prequel to the first game, but the next movie can\u2019t be a prequel since it is already confirmed to be set after the first film, with Josh Hutcherson returning so unless he magically gets de-aged I can\u2019t see the new movie being set in the past, so basically having 2 or more abandoned Freddy\u2019s locations makes sense in this timeline. \nAlso regarding the \u201cGemma\u201d and \u201cDarrin\u201d names it\u2019s common for screenwriters to use an anonym when writing a character who\u2019s identity is not meant to be revealed at the time, and especially since this is Scott who we are talking about who loves his secrets and red herrings. \nScott is another reason why I\u2019m leaning to script 4 because as much as I like script 3 I just don\u2019t believe Scott would reveal what seems like a very critical part of the movie in a script preview, think about all the tiny details in the games he goes so far to hide and have us theorize about. It just doesn\u2019t seem like him to reveal something this way, that\u2019s never been his style.\nSo I\u2019m pretty confident that script 4 is our winner.",

Next likely to me seems Script 1, which seems less like a conclusion to me than setting up for a plot twist, with Vanessa being forced to \"free\" the animatronics, only for it to be revealed that they have been set free to roam and murder on their own (or something similar). That would explain its being so early in the movie.",

For anyone who may not fully understand the page numbering system in contrast with the film, a good rule of thumb is that every page = 1 minute of screen time. So that would mean with the toy chica page, that whole thing would've happened loosely 25 minutes into the film, which would be absolutely insane in my opinion. Honestly, either of the last two seem pretty plausible, but I think most likely it'll be the third one, regarding how much it doesn't reveal about the plot plus the page number, but the last one could totally work as well!!",

            "content": "Film student here! Typically, when it comes to scripts, a general rule of thumb is one page of a script equals 1 minute in the final film, so if we're looking at the pages from a story perspective, placing them into a cohesive story... I'd say either the 3rd or 4th one flow the best, not saying that the others aren't likely either... but they do flow the best. \n\nFor the 3rd one, Mike burning plushies in sort of a co-op mission could lead to a climax and resolution at the end of the film given it's page 58, making it around an hour mark would leave enough time for a resolution. \n\nSimilar reasoning for the 4th one, this sequence would be early on in the film... possibly being an event from the past, which would then connect somehow to something later in the movie. \n\nThe reason I don't think the 1st one is likely is because based on where Vanessa was left off in the first film, how likely is it that she's out of the hospital... there could be a time jump, perhaps she was watching Abby and they were kidnapped by an animatronic... but the suspense in the scene just seems too much for what would be the half hour mark in what will probably be close to a 2 hour film. \n\nAs for the 2nd one... it's just a bit much in all honesty. This scene seems what is typically exposition, giving the audience some backstory... and it's just unusual to place this in 20 minutes in. Then again, this is Scott we're talking about... and perhaps we meet these characters earlier in the film... but I can't imagine an event taking place that would even involve the US Government with Fazbear Entertainment this early on, if at all in the franchise. \n\nI'm honestly happy to talk more about this too, disecting scripts is essentially what I study at school... ha!!",

            "content": "Hii, I'm a film graduate and I have some thoughts. This will be a LONG text (1114 words lol) explaining my opinion and I apologize if there's smth hard to understand (English isn't my first language) but, in a nutshell, I think the fourth and last script is the real one bc, from a narrative standpoint, it would make a good start for the movie AND it's written correctly (although not having numbered scenes is infuriating but alas, none of the scenes in other scripts are numbered, so maybe it's a weird standard from US filming industry, idk). \n\nI also think that \"the man\" can't be (or at least shouldn't be) any important character unlike Darrin and Gemma. Why? Well, when you hand the script to the actors and actresses, they need to know the role they are playing, so hiding the identity of the character in a script that only the staff would read and that everyone working on it knows who the character is is unnecessary and even confusing. A script is meant to guide the actors and describe ONLY what is shown on the screen objectively. \n\nI agree that it's weird that a dad goes into an abandoned Freddy's and KNOWS his way around (if he didn't, he wouldn't have known that the carousel has a door that leads to a staircase and wouldn't enter it without second thoughts) so my guess is that he's an employee from Freddy's, like a technician or smth similar. As to why he'd be bringing his kids to an abandoned location? Idk, maybe William ordered him to do so (either by manipulation or intimidation) or some other reason. I can imagine lots of possibilities tbh, but we won't know until the movie comes out.\n\nBut why am I so sure it's the last one? Well, I'm not 100% sure bc the third one is also very plausible to be real, but feels weird that in minute 58 of the movie (as others said down here in the comments, the numbering system of a script is 1 page is 1 minute of the film) Mike is getting ready to kinda sneak in a guarded location, either FNAF 2 location with the toy animatronics or somewhere else. The standard length for a movie is between 1h 30 min and 2h and, assuming that the film will be at least 2h, this is happening right in the middle of the film, which feels weird bc there would be 1h more of action when this feels like the start of the climax of the movie, which actually would make a bit more sense if the movie was around 1h 30 min. However, knowing that the first movie was 1h 50 min, I HIGHLY doubt that this one will be shorter bc there's A LOT more material than in the first one (for starters, there are twice as many animatronics than in the first movie that have to be narratively presented and developed and the budget of the movie is clearly a lot higher, so there's no way it will be shorter). So yeah, the third one just feels weird timing-wise.\n\nAbout the second script... Well, I won't even touch the thing about remnant and government funding the pizzaplex BUT what definitively sent me off is that it's not written correctly. It might be considered nitpicking BUT as I said before, a script has to describe the actions seen on screen objectively, so the paragraph where the men and women at the table are \"obviously surprised to hear that blah blah blah\" is NOT an objective action. It's a description of the character's thought process and/or viewer interpretation and is a basic error in script writing. A script isn't a novel and has many rules concerning it's writing, and that's one of the basic ones that any of us film students granted us an F many times when we were starting to write scripts (I used to write novels, so I obviously learned this the hard way). Also, the annotations (the brief text under the name of the character's dialogue) are incorrect bc an annotation is an indication of the emotions or expressions that a character is doing like \"(looks distressed)\" or \"(in a sad tone)\" that are meant for the actor to understand the tone of the actions and dialogue they're doing. However, all the annotations in this script are actions like \"waving a hand\" or \"thumping the paper\", which are also written incorrectly bc ALL verbs have to be in a present tense, not in gerund bc those verbs are narrative, which I've already said that it's a no-go in script writing. So yeah, if this script is the real one, I'd be disappointed MAINLY bc that script is supposed to be written by a professional, and no professional should make such basic errors.\n\nFinally, about the first script, for starters my brain hurts while trying to understand how the action is being presented, so that says a lot. Again, it's written like if it was a novel, which I said it's a basic error, but, aside from that, the action described is weird by itself. From a timing standpoint, this happening 25 min in the movie is simply weird: it has no flow of action purpose, feels really forced and basically this should happen either at the start of the movie where the plot conflict is presented, at the start of the climax deepening the conflict (Vanessa and Abby are tricked by William/other antagonist to do smth through Toy Chica) or at the end of the movie where the conflict is solved with a weirdly happy ending that wouldn't suit this franchise at all. Also, from a lore standpoint, it feels off that Toy Chica, out of all Toy animatronics, can talk so fluidly bc I don't remember the Toy animatronics having a complex voice box. That actually would fit more to what I remember about the Funtimes with the voice luring system and stuff. However, as literally no one else called this out, not even Dawko, I'm going to assume that I have the animatronics all mixed up.\n\nSo that would be my reasoning as to why I think the last script would be the more fitting to be an actual movie script. I just wish they number the scenes bc oh boy not numbering them just makes filming REALLY complicated for everyone in the set, and I'm talking through experience. Also, if you've read all this to the end omg you are crazy and thank you so much, I hope this was as educational for you as it was infuriating to me lol",

The carousel one reveals the least about the story, flows really well, and feels like it could be a tie-in to Sister Location and/or the carousel from Help Wanted 2. I don't know why Scott would bring up those lore pieces specifically, but it's very mysterious and interesting. No matter what we get, I'm so excited \u2014 we already know it's gonna be great. It's so awesome to have a creator like Scott, who we all know we can trust; a creator who is always gonna do everything he can to do right by his characters and lore. Even if he messes up sometimes, he's always trying his best lol",

Knowing that the fnaf 2 location did in fact have it's own killing (or at least is believed to be) from the fnaf 2 minigames, I think this makes a good motive for actually going there and having a goal rather than just being a night guard.\nMy theory is that in the movie universe, the toys are not haunted but will still attack them because they're quite literally criminals, breaking in and trying to set fire to the place. If there was an MCI, then Afton would've hid the bodies in the withereds since they're bigger than the toys and locked in parts and service. Or yk, have the toys also be haunted since they're made from the withereds. Either way it's interesting to think about",

I also someone some mention what the book was, the one Abby mentioned, based on a real book it seems. Plus what bugs me about the last page is a few things. Number one, is how is there a staircase inside the carousel? With a regular size one I would understand but this carousel is inside a building so it can\u2019t be too huge, as least not big enough for a staircase to fit in the middle. Another thing is the carousel characters. Ofc there the main 4, but why a gator, a wolf, and a hippo? Now you might be thinking just random animals but this is inside a Freddy\u2019s so why those animals? Ofc we have these animals in the franchise, gator -> Monty (SB), all though that a problem because SB comes from the future, or can be a tied to the green mask kid we see in the Happiest Day(?) minigame in FNaF 3 (this will be important later). Wolf -> Twisted wolf from the books but the books, and the hippo could be a tie to another mask kid from the Happiest day minigame or Mr. Hippo but Hippo comes Pizza Sim (FNaF 6) but I remember from MatPat\u2019s old timeline video, a theory was that the mediocre melodies are old robotics from Henry before he joined with William to make Fredbear. Now this these characters could just be an Easter egg to these characters (like they could make the wolf half broken like Twisted Wolf) but why this random assortment of characters? Some could work such as the gator tied to the mask kid or the hippo also tied with the other mask kid but also the Melodie animatronics being old theory being confirmed (at least in the movie setting).",

Ik cc is a boy in the games but so was Cassidy a girl so maybe they genderswapped them.

Which would mean no Abby, and no Mike unless he\u2019s a child in the mid to late 80s. Which leads me to feeling like the 4th script is probably the real one because it has no presence of Abby or Mike. However I\u2019m confuse on why it\u2019d be abandoned. Unsure. \n\nAlso if Matthew Lillard was signed on for 3 movies, he\u2019s gotta make his appearance in this movie. I doubt it\u2019s gonna be after the first movie cause well, he died getting spring locked. He wouldn\u2019t come back for a long time and by then he\u2019d be a corpse inside of what we know as springtrap. I highly doubt they\u2019re gonna do a timejump where Mike and Abby are older and then Matthew makes his appearance. That\u2019d be skipping fnaf 2 and going directly to fnaf 3. \n\nMy prediction is this movie is gonna be a prequel, it\u2019s gonna show the events of fnaf two and whatever else they\u2019ll throw in.",

As for the \"man\" it's going to be one of those \"telling of the beginning\" stories, like, the haunting movie called \"the Messengers\" I can see a starting of a horror story like this just laying out the story and 4th one seems to hit it on the dot. I could be wrong I just grew up watching a lot of scary movies and this seems like a crazy good scene so far.",

However, it feels like the first three pages would either be crammed with info, or just barren/vague and confuse people.\n\nThe other script with Mike and Abby talking about the \u201cplushies\u201d is probably referencing the story of the \u201cVelveteen Rabbit\u201d which I loved as a kid but am now disturbed by haha. The page number being in the 50\u2019s range tells me that it is in the middle of the script (industry standard script length for most movies is around 80-120 pages, and 1 page = 1 Minute), aka where our heroes do something that will trigger the start of the final act. \n\nMake what you will of this, Thanks for reading!\n\nP.s, tell Scott I'd love to write a spinoff book featuring Carlton from the silver eyes as a paranormal investigator, I feel like it would have potential and just makes sense ;)",

It's usually what you're taught when script-writing, but generally 1 page of a script is equal to 1 minute screen time. The first page is just absurd. So much goes on in that scene it would feel over the top. Same with the military script. \nThe page about the plushies is interesting however.\u00a0It would definitely make more sense with context, maybe it's referring to a discussion the characters have already had? If something is wrong with the toy animatronics why is it up to Mike, Abby and Vanessa to fix them?\nFinally, the last page.\u00a0I felt like it flowed much better too, and it was a good little opening considering its only page 4. But my theory is that this little secret room is a room William created, since it seemed well hidden and not behind any ordinary staff door. I think it could have been a place he used to kill, or tamper with the animatronics in a sneaky way.\u00a0\nThough god knows how this guy (I'm assuming he was a former worker) found out about it, and felt the need to bring his kids.\u00a0\nAlso, would it seem a bit repetitive that both films take place in an abandoned pizzeria? I'd like to think that it takes place whilst the pizzeria is still functioning, though that's unlikely....The more that I think about it, the more I believe the infected plushie script.",

With the third one, it feels like something that would happen, I think the only bit that wouldn't be in the script is \"We got a job to do\" but Abby talking about that story seems in character for her and lastly while I do love the idea Dawko put forward and I can see that being the case, I also think it could be that, the bit saying the building is abandoned is the red herring, as if you take the script and change it so that its after hours, it would make sense for a  employee to take their kids there after hours to look at the animatronics up close, could possibly be a previous night guard but it definitely feels like something that would happen in the opening of the film",

            "content": "I feel like the script to where on page 25 to where it says \"The grip loosens, and Vanessa watches Toy Chica look back at the computer.\" I feel like that script might be real, speaking because in the first Fnaf movie, Mike was dreaming a few times in the film. So maybe the reason why this is early on, could be either Vanessa Mike dreaming about this happening, even before they go into restaurant later in the movie. Kind of like a premonition.\n\nAnd the other script about the Dad taking his two kids to the abandoned restaurant. I feel that, that would probably be a part of the beginning of the film. \n\nI don't really have much to say about that one, but if it's not that script, then I feel that it's the first script that I mentioned.\n\nIt could also be the one to where they are talking about Scarlet Fever. I feel that it's also likely to be that one because, when Mike calls Vanessa, what if it was Mike having that dream about Chica looking at the camera, because he asks Vanessa if she has work or not? And since she says no, and he tells her to get ready, he just has a feeling or knows where another restaurant is or was built.\n\nMike having that dream, makes sure that nothing happens. But then what if Mike and Vanessa were both having the same dream, and once Mike tells Vanessa about his plans, she thinks that it's a bad idea.\n\nDon't get mad at me if I'm reaching a little bit. Fnaf Fan Theories have stretched out in a theory way more than this one. I'm just guessing here?",

The way he talks to Vanessa was a bit strange too. Maybe not enough context?\n\nso honestly, I think the man and the kids might be the real one! Like an opening scene (maybe flashback?) since its so early, it makes sense to  not be the main characters (like in the first movie with the guard) \n\nBut that's just a theory\ud83d\udc40 guess now we just have to wait",

Maybe like the \"introduction\" to the animatronics similar to the first movie, where nightguard guy gets killed by Foxy. The movie opens with this family, a dad and his two children, who are going into the Pizzeria for whatever reason. \n\nMaybe the dad is looking for something from his past, or he's into some shady dealings or something. It could be that the dad is a criminal, like he's escaped from prison or something, and he takes his unknowing children to the Pizzeria to hide out, but the Toy Animatronics with their criminal database systems attack him. This would give the audience and introduction to the Toy Animatronics, their functions, the Pizzeria itself, all without being too similar to the first movie's intro.",

It's also a reference too one of the failed concepts for the first movie that scott told us about. Something regarding the army using Fazbear technology in the military or something.\n\nPage 58: Def the 2nd most convincing one, however still probably fake. It seems like yet another reference to a failed concept, this one being the infamous \"plushies take manhattan\" pitch from years ago. Also Mike's line at the end doesn't seem in character for him. But your thoughts on the plushie story being an analogy is a very good point.\n\nPage 4: Makes the most sense. This seems like a cold open to the film establishing that there was more than one location in the timeline. And the vagueness of the context of the scene makes it seem like it's real. The line \"we're not here for a ride sweetie.\" shows a clear ulterior motive that would probably be set up in the next minutes of the script. Also it's the only one that references something from the actual fnaf 2 location and uses it as part of the story. Unlike page 25 which only references toy chica existing.",

For anyone who may not fully understand the page numbering system in contrast with the film, a good rule of thumb is that every page = 1 minute of screen time. So that would mean with the toy chica page, that whole thing would've happened loosely 25 minutes into the film, which would be absolutely insane in my opinion. Honestly, either of the last two seem pretty plausible, but I think most likely it'll be the third one, regarding how much it doesn't reveal about the plot plus the page number, but the last one could totally work as well!!",

And amidst all the studies disguised as safety procedures, maybe William or Henry sneaks a remnant study in there that goes unnoticed until that scene. In general I'd also find it interesting to see if maybe they show William being removed from Fazbear Entertainment after being caught for the murders (dispite being released due to the lack of evidence from how well he hid the bodies). In general I'm curious to see what roles William will play in flashbacks or the present as well as if and when they decide to introduce Henry.",

Well, judging by the direction the elbow in bending to, we are looking at him from the back, not from the front, and if you visualize how it would look like from the front, you'd realize that the arm it has is its left arm and the one it's missing is its right arm, while Withered Bonnie is the exact opposite. Also, if you look into the endo's back, you can see the word \"Bonnie\" written in a light blue, so I'm pretty sure that it's Toy Bonnie's endo. And if you're wondering why it says \"W.Bonnie\" in the circular platform besides the endo, then that's because THAT's where WITHERED BONNIE'S ACTUAL ENDO will be placed",

          "content": "Scott, I would propose an alternative explanation for the waffling of Boeing and the Leadership there.  Boeing has been led by leadership over the last couple of decades that has been very cavalier about safety vs. \"the bottom line\".  They have been caught up in massive lawsuits and bad press and don't at this point need any more of that.  They want to take the chance and send the astronauts home on the Starliner, buuuut the standard risk you talk about has suddenly become a more important and concern than previous due the sudden attack of risk aversion.  I think this is the more important issue and the bad press from keeping the Astronauts up there is much less than the risk of possible catastrophe on re-entry, as long as the potential for fixing the issues and lowering the risk on the Starliner re-entry.  Boeing has not previously been too risk averse in the Aircraft safety defects dropping planes out the skies and killing thousands of people, but the consequences of that attitude have been much more severe than they have calculated and planned for in their financial spreadsheet.  Just my personal opinion!  I personally think their best outcome would be to bring the Astronauts home on Dragon and send the Starliner home by itself.  If it fails re-entry, the leadership can claim good precautionary judgement and if it survives re-entry, they can claim good judgement in not risking the Astronauts.   The only other factor is what Boeing would consider is the embarrassment of having to be bailed out by Elon Musk, but I think their spinmeisters in their Company can spin this to mitigate the embarrassment factorf quite well.  Again, just my personal opinion.  Thanks for the opportunity to expound.",

But on ISS I bet you get bored of looking at Earth after two weeks. I am more worried about their mental health than the capsule, they can always ditch the capsule (not so simple as you point out) and take a hike on SpaceX or other company vehicle or even Soyuz if the things get really bad (again not so simple).\nBasically even throwing the capsule away represents a potential danger to ISS itself because of the thrusters and they didn't testes the automatic part of the software.

An 8-day mission could turn into an 8-month one. \n* *[**1:16**]* *Contingency Plans:* NASA has backup plans ready if Starliner can't safely return the astronauts. Options include:\n    * *[**1:47**]* Sending a Dragon spacecraft with only two astronauts instead of four, bringing the Starliner crew back after 6 more months on the ISS.\n    * *[**2:08**]* Utilizing the cargo pallet on the Crew-8 Dragon for astronaut return.\n* *[**2:34**]* *Safety Concerns:* NASA is hesitant about clearing Starliner for re-entry due to unresolved technical issues, prioritizing astronaut safety above all else. The upcoming US election adds another layer of pressure on decision-making. \n* *[**4:57**]* *Thruster Issues:* Five maneuvering thrusters underperformed during approach to the ISS. While four are now back online, the cause remains uncertain. \n* *[**7:01**]* *Potential Cause:* Boeing believes the issue might stem from Teflon seals inside the oxidizer poppets (valves). Overheating may have caused the seals to extrude, interfering with oxidizer flow.\n* *[**9:18**]* *Blame Game:* This incident might spark another dispute between Boeing and Aerojet Rocketdyne (thruster manufacturer) regarding responsibility for the technical failure.  \n* *[**5:56**]* *Software Concerns:* Configuration changes made to the software for crewed flight haven't been fully tested due to Boeing's cost-cutting measures. \n* *[**11:48**]* *Future Implications:* Even if Starliner returns without crew, Boeing could push for operational status, despite the need for technical fixes. However, the limited availability of Atlas V rockets for future launches poses a significant challenge. \n\nI used Google Gemini 1.5 Pro to summarize the transcript.\nCost (if I didn't use the free tier): $0.0529\nTime: 20.78 seconds\nInput tokens: 12685\nOutput tokens: 805",

Then there are supposed to be more people designing and executing tests. Boeing needs to flush its corporate leadership and promote Engineers to run things again.

Is there anything new and different about Starliner's type? I think Scott mentioned that helium is used somehow to open the valves? The ones I'm familiar with all have electrically activated solenoid valves - are Starliner's different? I'm curious, but I'd also ask why Boeing's preflight testing didn't find this problem. And why didn't it show up in the earlier flights? More \"cost sensitivity\"?",

Ever since the McDonald Douglas management group moved in Boeing quality has really deteriorated.  I think NASA needs new management also.  It's like they have forgotten how to get to the moon and back and are having to reinvent the wheel.  After the Apollo 1 tragedy, NASA went back to the manufacturer of the capsule (North American Rockwell), took the Apollo capsule apart and looked closely at  every nut and bolt and wire.  It almost put the Presidential deadline in jeopardy but they came back out with a Capsule that the Astronauts would fly in.  Except for Apollo 13 it performed marvelously.  NASA needs to take a step back and look hard the Starliner and Boeing and test that spacecraft merticulously on the ground in and out of a vacuum chamber to make sure ALL components work correctly.  And don't give Boeing any more money.  They bid on it and they need to live within their bid.",

It was engineers all the way up, from the people in the drafting rooms all the way up to the board of directors. That changed at roughly the same time as Boeing acquired McDonnal-Douglas.\nNow upper management is all \"bean-counter\" accountant/marketing types. They lack the education to understand the product their business produces, and so the quality and safety of that product suffers greatly for it.\nThey're optimizing for shareholder profits, and not for product performance.\nThe airplanes aren't the product anymore. The stock price is. And so if you want an airplane from Boeing and not profits from owning stock, you're going to get a sub-par product.\n\nThere's a similar reality distortion which has happened with YouTube's management decisions in the past few years (more apparent the more recent the decision was made).\nCreators aren't the customer. Neither is the viewer. The ad providers are the customer, because they're the ones providing the vast majority of the income. What does that make the creators and the viewers? It makes us the product, we're cultivated and harvested like wheat, as long as we keep watching ads and keep making videos to put ads on (even if the creators themselves don't make any money on those ads).\nDark patterns everywhere you look, and I only started noticing them in late 2016. Can't find the \"block this user\" button anymore? Youtube has decided it wants you to see all the videos, even the ones you don't want to see, because the ones you don't want to see are the ones it thinks you are most likely to sit thru and comment on (and by doing so, be subjected to the ads, which pays YouTube).",

Maybe Boeing can get a ride on Arianne. \n\nAnd that's quite hysterical, given how Boeing bitched so hard during the COTS awards that it should be given SpaceX's money, because SpaceX and Sierra and Blue Origin were all clearly inferior companies that would never make anything that worked.  That big badass old Boeing of the Apollo days is gone.  What we're seeing is a combination of Boeing resting on its laurels and prior legacy, while their management was hollowed-out and replaced by MBA goons from the Cult of Jack Welch, who, in their holy war for shareholder value, drove out all the engineers with the institutional knowledge and skill sets and best practices.

Now they have to make a decision whether to risk the two astronauts lives by trying to bring them home in the defective capsule, or admitting failure and bringing them home safely in a SpaceX Crew Dragon. Obviously being an election year and this being yet another Kamala Harris failure, they may well risk the astronauts lives and try bringing them back in Starliner to save face, or simply stall in making a decision until after the election.

I'm sure the guidance-package is a very large set of files (at least relative to the ISS download speeds).  And, I'm guessing here, they probably would attempt to upload it directly to the Starliner - not go to a computer on-board then kick it over to a thumbdrive and install it that way.  I'm confident that, if they go the route of having to upload it the ISS and then transfer it to spacecraft manually, they will probably have to write a program to upload and install on the ISS onboard computer that can read the Boeing guidance-package (because it's certainly formatted in a protocol that their current computers cannot understand).  No matter how they do it - the file is going to have to get transferred (after it has been written, error-checked, debugged, and formatted for transfer) over the course of hours or days and will be tying up a lot NASA and the ISS's data-transfer resources for quite some time.  Then they are going to have to repeat the process in reverse to make sure the file they sent up was received, unpacked, and installed without any corruption.  Basically, they will need to make sure the file they get back is the same file as the one they sent up and the Starliner guidance system doesn't see anything it doesn't like and spit the whole thing back out.  If they can, I imagine they want to upload directly to the Starliner via it's onboard antennas - but, between the communications going between the ISS and ground and the fact that they are hanging out in the middle of the ionosphere - they are very likely to have major interference problems if this wasn't a contingency the Boeing guys planned on.",

They don't want the Starliner failure festering in the news for the next month so they are pretending Starliner may still be viable. \n\nVery likely sometime about 3 weeks from now they will announce the plan to fold Butch and Suni into Crew-9 and return them on Dragon when Crew-9 rotates back to Earth. They will then try to put the best spin they can on Starliner claiming this all being done out of an abundance of caution.

They will have to switch a few of the 6 flights to Crew Dragon to stay on track leaving only 4 flights.  I think Boeing will pull out since they are hemorrhaging money and can't recover it with just 4 flights.  Odds are that SpaceX flys all the remaining crewed flights to ISS IMO",

I listened carefully to the press conference (available at The Launch Pad, among other places) and even listened to some passages several times: some things were presented differently than some people are now saying. \nIt is quite clear that Starliner is better than its current reputation and that a decision in favor of the safety of astronauts and decision makers on Earth is not a judgment on Starliner. It is clear that Boeing engineers approach the matter a little differently than others. However, the press conference made it clear that NASA remains committed to Starliner and that a decision in favor of safety would not be a final verdict. Space is hard and complicated. Unknown problems are normal and don't need to be treated overly dramatically. Thank you for your objective approach! By the way, I can only recommend everyone to listen to engineers like TMRO rather than people who want to generate attention with false interpretations.",

NASA and Boeing, will make suggestions for changes (based on their experts experience) to the proposed design with \"action items\" that have to be completed by the builder before manufacture of the component can start. The builder then manufactures the \"First Article or Pathfinder\" component which then is tested to the customer's requirements.  The results of the testing are then reviewed again by NASA and Boeing at a CDR (Critical Design Review).  The contractor is usually given another \"action item\" burn-down list to complete before any \"Production Parts\" can be manufactured.  In the case of any of the working components on Starliner, NASA, Boeing and the supplier were all in agreement before production of any Doghouse Components were ever built.  Usually the testing regimen far exceeds whatever expected operating conditions during a nominal flight usually by a multiple factor. In this case it sounds like the environmental testing that did occur, did not expose this weakness in the system.  There is lot more going on here than most people realize.",

The RCS is not operating in a predictable manner the autodock software cannot compensate for the unpredictable operation of the RCS. The helium leaks and the uploading the automation software are cover stories for defective RCS thrusters. Scott I don't agree with you assessment that it is fractions of percent for a failure. They are therorizing that if they use the thrusters to undock that they will fail after that and become unusable for reentry profile to stablize the craft for the retroburn and SM jettision.",

I think the biggest thing for me, is not that the seals are bad, things go wrong as long as it is fixed it should be ok.  It is that Boeing has shown time and time again that they are incapable of managing a large project properly.  The fact that Boeing will likely blame Aerojet is EXACTLY why NASA needs to slow their roll with Starliner and make doubly sure that everything is working before proceeding.  It is clear that Boeing is not doing their due diligence when it comes to being a lead project manager (*cough* 737 MAX *cough*).",

Everyone wants there to be competition and more than one supplier, but cutting corners to ensure that one vendor gets certified is a recipe for the preventable loss of life on a spacecraft. \n\nIf asking Boeing  to go back and address their spacecraft problems in a methodical and well thought out manner means that they back out of the program, that is insufficient reason to allow for decreased safety margins with respect to loss of life and/or vehicle.",

Because of this uncertainty I'm more inclined to believe that Boeing wants to update the automation software to handle RCS thruster failures better on return than it did during the docking procedure.  It doesn't make sense that it would take a month for them to simply dust-off previously-used automation software.  I remember that there were communications problems during the first uncrewed Starliner test, and I don't think they want the software to simply disable an underperforming thruster and fail-over to human ground control if there's any possibility of loss of contact while trying to avoid a collision with the ISS.  While I'm not a big Boeing fan, I do think that Starliner really isn't that far off from being safe and reliable transport to and from the ISS.  They just have to get over what looks like a perfect storm of relatively minor problems that are combining into a potential disaster.  Thanks for the additional insight to this situation...",

And then there's the general disruption to the ISS schedule, again presumably requiring NASA to allocate its own resource to plan around those disruptions, something that wouldn't have been necessary had this Starliner mission not gone so far off its mission plan.\n\nBasically I'm thinking there must be a load of consequential losses to NASA as a result of this Starliner failure and I really hope that NASA is going to be able to come after Boeing for compensation for disruption to its other activities once everyone is safe. I fear though that there might be specific wording in the Starliner contract precluding any Boeing liability for NASA consequential losses but I hope I'm wrong.",

On the other hand, this puts Butch and Suni in greater danger later in the mission if thruster failures prevent successful reentry. I think the software changes they are talking about for automatic undocking will be incorporating additional contingencies for thruster failures which have only been worked out during the last few weeks. NASA is being cagy about this because it raises questions about the safety of the automated undocking in 2022.",

            "content": "Scott, I would propose an alternative explanation for the waffling of Boeing and the Leadership there.  Boeing has been led by leadership over the last couple of decades that has been very cavalier about safety vs. \"the bottom line\".  They have been caught up in massive lawsuits and bad press and don't at this point need any more of that.  They want to take the chance and send the astronauts home on the Starliner, buuuut the standard risk you talk about has suddenly become a more important and concern than previous due the sudden attack of risk aversion.  I think this is the more important issue and the bad press from keeping the Astronauts up there is much less than the risk of possible catastrophe on re-entry, as long as the potential for fixing the issues and lowering the risk on the Starliner re-entry.  Boeing has not previously been too risk averse in the Aircraft safety defects dropping planes out the skies and killing thousands of people, but the consequences of that attitude have been much more severe than they have calculated and planned for in their financial spreadsheet.  Just my personal opinion!  I personally think their best outcome would be to bring the Astronauts home on Dragon and send the Starliner home by itself.  If it fails re-entry, the leadership can claim good precautionary judgement and if it survives re-entry, they can claim good judgement in not risking the Astronauts.   The only other factor is what Boeing would consider is the embarrassment of having to be bailed out by Elon Musk, but I think their spinmeisters in their Company can spin this to mitigate the embarrassment factorf quite well.  Again, just my personal opinion.  Thanks for the opportunity to expound.",

That changed at roughly the same time as Boeing acquired McDonnal-Douglas.\nNow upper management is all \"bean-counter\" accountant/marketing types. They lack the education to understand the product their business produces, and so the quality and safety of that product suffers greatly for it.\nThey're optimizing for shareholder profits, and not for product performance.\nThe airplanes aren't the product anymore. The stock price is. And so if you want an airplane from Boeing and not profits from owning stock, you're going to get a sub-par product.\n\nThere's a similar reality distortion which has happened with YouTube's management decisions in the past few years (more apparent the more recent the decision was made).\nCreators aren't the customer. Neither is the viewer. The ad providers are the customer, because they're the ones providing the vast majority of the income. What does that make the creators and the viewers? It makes us the product, we're cultivated and harvested like wheat, as long as we keep watching ads and keep making videos to put ads on (even if the creators themselves don't make any money on those ads).\nDark patterns everywhere you look, and I only started noticing them in late 2016. Can't find the \"block this user\" button anymore? Youtube has decided it wants you to see all the videos, even the ones you don't want to see, because the ones you don't want to see are the ones it thinks you are most likely to sit thru and comment on (and by doing so, be subjected to the ads, which pays YouTube).",

Considering NASA will likely demand a whole new series of tests for the revised system before certification happens, I don't expect to see Starliner in space again for as much as two years, and it might just get cancelled altogether. I think we'll see the Sierra spaceplane certified for cargo and beginning crew certifications before Starliner is back in the mix.  Heck, New Glenn might be certified before Starliner.  Maybe Boeing can get a ride on Arianne. \n\nAnd that's quite hysterical, given how Boeing bitched so hard during the COTS awards that it should be given SpaceX's money, because SpaceX and Sierra and Blue Origin were all clearly inferior companies that would never make anything that worked.  That big badass old Boeing of the Apollo days is gone.  What we're seeing is a combination of Boeing resting on its laurels and prior legacy, while their management was hollowed-out and replaced by MBA goons from the Cult of Jack Welch, who, in their holy war for shareholder value, drove out all the engineers with the institutional knowledge and skill sets and best practices. The Boeing aerospace name now is like one of those zombie company names you can lease to put on any product, like Polaroid and Bell & Howell.",

They have literally no good resume in these things but get chosen over and over again. It all seems super slimey andd fishy and backwards",

They don't want the Starliner failure festering in the news for the next month so they are pretending Starliner may still be viable. \n\nVery likely sometime about 3 weeks from now they will announce the plan to fold Butch and Suni into Crew-9 and return them on Dragon when Crew-9 rotates back to Earth. They will then try to put the best spin they can on Starliner claiming this all being done out of an abundance of caution.

Because of this uncertainty I'm more inclined to believe that Boeing wants to update the automation software to handle RCS thruster failures better on return than it did during the docking procedure.  It doesn't make sense that it would take a month for them to simply dust-off previously-used automation software.  I remember that there were communications problems during the first uncrewed Starliner test, and I don't think they want the software to simply disable an underperforming thruster and fail-over to human ground control if there's any possibility of loss of contact while trying to avoid a collision with the ISS.  While I'm not a big Boeing fan, I do think that Starliner really isn't that far off from being safe and reliable transport to and from the ISS.  They just have to get over what looks like a perfect storm of relatively minor problems that are combining into a potential disaster.  Thanks for the additional insight to this situation...",

On the other hand, this puts Butch and Suni in greater danger later in the mission if thruster failures prevent successful reentry. I think the software changes they are talking about for automatic undocking will be incorporating additional contingencies for thruster failures which have only been worked out during the last few weeks. NASA is being cagy about this because it raises questions about the safety of the automated undocking in 2022.",

            "content": "Scott, I would propose an alternative explanation for the waffling of Boeing and the Leadership there.  Boeing has been led by leadership over the last couple of decades that has been very cavalier about safety vs. \"the bottom line\".  They have been caught up in massive lawsuits and bad press and don't at this point need any more of that.  They want to take the chance and send the astronauts home on the Starliner, buuuut the standard risk you talk about has suddenly become a more important and concern than previous due the sudden attack of risk aversion.  I think this is the more important issue and the bad press from keeping the Astronauts up there is much less than the risk of possible catastrophe on re-entry, as long as the potential for fixing the issues and lowering the risk on the Starliner re-entry.  Boeing has not previously been too risk averse in the Aircraft safety defects dropping planes out the skies and killing thousands of people, but the consequences of that attitude have been much more severe than they have calculated and planned for in their financial spreadsheet.  Just my personal opinion!  I personally think their best outcome would be to bring the Astronauts home on Dragon and send the Starliner home by itself.  If it fails re-entry, the leadership can claim good precautionary judgement and if it survives re-entry, they can claim good judgement in not risking the Astronauts.   The only other factor is what Boeing would consider is the embarrassment of having to be bailed out by Elon Musk, but I think their spinmeisters in their Company can spin this to mitigate the embarrassment factorf quite well.  Again, just my personal opinion.  Thanks for the opportunity to expound.",

But on ISS I bet you get bored of looking at Earth after two weeks. I am more worried about their mental health than the capsule, they can always ditch the capsule (not so simple as you point out) and take a hike on SpaceX or other company vehicle or even Soyuz if the things get really bad (again not so simple).\nBasically even throwing the capsule away represents a potential danger to ISS itself because of the thrusters and they didn't testes the automatic part of the software.

An 8-day mission could turn into an 8-month one. \n* *[**1:16**]* *Contingency Plans:* NASA has backup plans ready if Starliner can't safely return the astronauts. Options include:\n    * *[**1:47**]* Sending a Dragon spacecraft with only two astronauts instead of four, bringing the Starliner crew back after 6 more months on the ISS.\n    * *[**2:08**]* Utilizing the cargo pallet on the Crew-8 Dragon for astronaut return.\n* *[**2:34**]* *Safety Concerns:* NASA is hesitant about clearing Starliner for re-entry due to unresolved technical issues, prioritizing astronaut safety above all else. The upcoming US election adds another layer of pressure on decision-making. \n* *[**4:57**]* *Thruster Issues:* Five maneuvering thrusters underperformed during approach to the ISS. While four are now back online, the cause remains uncertain. \n* *[**7:01**]* *Potential Cause:* Boeing believes the issue might stem from Teflon seals inside the oxidizer poppets (valves). Overheating may have caused the seals to extrude, interfering with oxidizer flow.\n* *[**9:18**]* *Blame Game:* This incident might spark another dispute between Boeing and Aerojet Rocketdyne (thruster manufacturer) regarding responsibility for the technical failure.  \n* *[**5:56**]* *Software Concerns:* Configuration changes made to the software for crewed flight haven't been fully tested due to Boeing's cost-cutting measures. \n* *[**11:48**]* *Future Implications:* Even if Starliner returns without crew, Boeing could push for operational status, despite the need for technical fixes. However, the limited availability of Atlas V rockets for future launches poses a significant challenge. \n\nI used Google Gemini 1.5 Pro to summarize the transcript.\nCost (if I didn't use the free tier): $0.0529\nTime: 20.78 seconds\nInput tokens: 12685\nOutput tokens: 805",

That worked well until reaching a fume temperature of about 220\u00b0C. Then the teflon pipes began bubbling up, expanding by a good third of their size and after that, if those received even more heat, they became brittle like styrofoam. That's the reason, why teflon isn't a good sealing material when it involves heat! Better for that is the red coloured silicone, up to 350\u00b0C or the black coloured high temp silicon up to a 1000\u00b0C. And I never worked in material R&D or aviation, I worked in biomass oven industry. \ud83d\ude02",

Then there are supposed to be more people designing and executing tests. Boeing needs to flush its corporate leadership and promote Engineers to run things again.

It's like they have forgotten how to get to the moon and back and are having to reinvent the wheel.  After the Apollo 1 tragedy, NASA went back to the manufacturer of the capsule (North American Rockwell), took the Apollo capsule apart and looked closely at  every nut and bolt and wire.  It almost put the Presidential deadline in jeopardy but they came back out with a Capsule that the Astronauts would fly in.  Except for Apollo 13 it performed marvelously.  NASA needs to take a step back and look hard the Starliner and Boeing and test that spacecraft merticulously on the ground in and out of a vacuum chamber to make sure ALL components work correctly.

It was engineers all the way up, from the people in the drafting rooms all the way up to the board of directors. That changed at roughly the same time as Boeing acquired McDonnal-Douglas.\nNow upper management is all \"bean-counter\" accountant/marketing types. They lack the education to understand the product their business produces, and so the quality and safety of that product suffers greatly for it.\nThey're optimizing for shareholder profits, and not for product performance.\nThe airplanes aren't the product anymore. The stock price is. And so if you want an airplane from Boeing and not profits from owning stock, you're going to get a sub-par product.\n\nThere's a similar reality distortion which has happened with YouTube's management decisions in the past few years (more apparent the more recent the decision was made).\nCreators aren't the customer. Neither is the viewer. The ad providers are the customer, because they're the ones providing the vast majority of the income. What does that make the creators and the viewers? It makes us the product, we're cultivated and harvested like wheat, as long as we keep watching ads and keep making videos to put ads on (even if the creators themselves don't make any money on those ads).\nDark patterns everywhere you look, and I only started noticing them in late 2016. Can't find the \"block this user\" button anymore? Youtube has decided it wants you to see all the videos, even the ones you don't want to see, because the ones you don't want to see are the ones it thinks you are most likely to sit thru and comment on (and by doing so, be subjected to the ads, which pays YouTube).",

Considering NASA will likely demand a whole new series of tests for the revised system before certification happens, I don't expect to see Starliner in space again for as much as two years, and it might just get cancelled altogether. I think we'll see the Sierra spaceplane certified for cargo and beginning crew certifications before Starliner is back in the mix.  Heck, New Glenn might be certified before Starliner.  Maybe Boeing can get a ride on Arianne. \n\nAnd that's quite hysterical, given how Boeing bitched so hard during the COTS awards that it should be given SpaceX's money, because SpaceX and Sierra and Blue Origin were all clearly inferior companies that would never make anything that worked.  That big badass old Boeing of the Apollo days is gone.  What we're seeing is a combination of Boeing resting on its laurels and prior legacy, while their management was hollowed-out and replaced by MBA goons from the Cult of Jack Welch, who, in their holy war for shareholder value, drove out all the engineers with the institutional knowledge and skill sets and best practices. The Boeing aerospace name now is like one of those zombie company names you can lease to put on any product, like Polaroid and Bell & Howell.",

Batteries will last for a while with non-essentials switched off, so evacuation can be orderly. As I understand it, the objection to 7 seats was a non life threatening injury.

I'm sure the guidance-package is a very large set of files (at least relative to the ISS download speeds).  And, I'm guessing here, they probably would attempt to upload it directly to the Starliner - not go to a computer on-board then kick it over to a thumbdrive and install it that way.  I'm confident that, if they go the route of having to upload it the ISS and then transfer it to spacecraft manually, they will probably have to write a program to upload and install on the ISS onboard computer that can read the Boeing guidance-package (because it's certainly formatted in a protocol that their current computers cannot understand).  No matter how they do it - the file is going to have to get transferred (after it has been written, error-checked, debugged, and formatted for transfer) over the course of hours or days and will be tying up a lot NASA and the ISS's data-transfer resources for quite some time.  Then they are going to have to repeat the process in reverse to make sure the file they sent up was received, unpacked, and installed without any corruption.  Basically, they will need to make sure the file they get back is the same file as the one they sent up and the Starliner guidance system doesn't see anything it doesn't like and spit the whole thing back out.  If they can, I imagine they want to upload directly to the Starliner via it's onboard antennas - but, between the communications going between the ISS and ground and the fact that they are hanging out in the middle of the ionosphere - they are very likely to have major interference problems if this wasn't a contingency the Boeing guys planned on.",

But before we do that we need to spend the following four weeks testing to make sure it works as intended.  And then when you send the plane on its way, the pilots are just passengers.\"  \n\nFlight automation software should be the default configuration for any capsule.  Computers tend to be faster and more accurate.  Pilots should be there to intervene when things go wrong.  Saying that the flight automation used in conjunction with human pilot intervention is not a tested configuration should elicit a very loud, WTF?!!!\n\nAnd yes, I am a software engineer...",

They don't want the Starliner failure festering in the news for the next month so they are pretending Starliner may still be viable. \n\nVery likely sometime about 3 weeks from now they will announce the plan to fold Butch and Suni into Crew-9 and return them on Dragon when Crew-9 rotates back to Earth. They will then try to put the best spin they can on Starliner claiming this all being done out of an abundance of caution. That Starliner is still safe and crap like that. \n\nOf course that's all bull and this likely the last time Starliner ever sees space.",

They will have to switch a few of the 6 flights to Crew Dragon to stay on track leaving only 4 flights.  I think Boeing will pull out since they are hemorrhaging money and can't recover it with just 4 flights.  Odds are that SpaceX flys all the remaining crewed flights to ISS IMO",

I listened carefully to the press conference (available at The Launch Pad, among other places) and even listened to some passages several times: some things were presented differently than some people are now saying. \nIt is quite clear that Starliner is better than its current reputation and that a decision in favor of the safety of astronauts and decision makers on Earth is not a judgment on Starliner. It is clear that Boeing engineers approach the matter a little differently than others. However, the press conference made it clear that NASA remains committed to Starliner and that a decision in favor of safety would not be a final verdict. Space is hard and complicated. Unknown problems are normal and don't need to be treated overly dramatically. Thank you for your objective approach! By the way, I can only recommend everyone to listen to engineers like TMRO rather than people who want to generate attention with false interpretations.",

NASA should have been \"the heavy\" and just cancelled their participation.  Therefore, the crew's safety is NASA's problem and responsibility.  If the crew perishes on Starliner, then NASA really needs undergo a very serious examination as to whether or not NASA should continue as an agency.",

NASA and Boeing, will make suggestions for changes (based on their experts experience) to the proposed design with \"action items\" that have to be completed by the builder before manufacture of the component can start. The builder then manufactures the \"First Article or Pathfinder\" component which then is tested to the customer's requirements.  The results of the testing are then reviewed again by NASA and Boeing at a CDR (Critical Design Review).  The contractor is usually given another \"action item\" burn-down list to complete before any \"Production Parts\" can be manufactured.  In the case of any of the working components on Starliner, NASA, Boeing and the supplier were all in agreement before production of any Doghouse Components were ever built.  Usually the testing regimen far exceeds whatever expected operating conditions during a nominal flight usually by a multiple factor. In this case it sounds like the environmental testing that did occur, did not expose this weakness in the system.  There is lot more going on here than most people realize.",

It's a symptom of the utter dysfunction at the heart of the entire company. Even if Starliner can move to operational missions on its next flight, some 12 months from now, there is barely enough time for Boeing to meet its CCtCap contractual obligation to provide six such flights before the ISS is deorbited. By contrast, SpaceX completed its six-flight obligation last year (seven years ahead of the earliest date Boeing will be able to complete its contract).\n\nIt's no wonder SpaceX has been given the job of providing the final deorbit capability for ISS. By the time Boeing would be able to do so, the ISS would already be scattered far and wide across the surface of Earth!",

It is that Boeing has shown time and time again that they are incapable of managing a large project properly.  The fact that Boeing will likely blame Aerojet is EXACTLY why NASA needs to slow their roll with Starliner and make doubly sure that everything is working before proceeding.  It is clear that Boeing is not doing their due diligence when it comes to being a lead project manager (*cough* 737 MAX *cough*).",

Because of this uncertainty I'm more inclined to believe that Boeing wants to update the automation software to handle RCS thruster failures better on return than it did during the docking procedure.  It doesn't make sense that it would take a month for them to simply dust-off previously-used automation software.  I remember that there were communications problems during the first uncrewed Starliner test, and I don't think they want the software to simply disable an underperforming thruster and fail-over to human ground control if there's any possibility of loss of contact while trying to avoid a collision with the ISS.  While I'm not a big Boeing fan, I do think that Starliner really isn't that far off from being safe and reliable transport to and from the ISS.  They just have to get over what looks like a perfect storm of relatively minor problems that are combining into a potential disaster.  Thanks for the additional insight to this situation...",

If the updated untested software could cause it to collide or drift in an uncontrolled way with the risk of it colliding at a later time. how about considering it as an extra permanent module to the ISS and leave it there. It could be used for storage. The Sunny and Butch can return on a Crew Dragon for as much as they are professional about all this they probably need a break from all the stress and uncertainty. So the main sacrifice is the loss of a docking port and due to the extra drag ISS may need a reboost more often. Where is the Cygnus docked? Is that not another usable docking port on the US side? So all the scheduling for future will have to change to accommodate this but it does seem like the least risky option to losing any lives,",

And then there's the general disruption to the ISS schedule, again presumably requiring NASA to allocate its own resource to plan around those disruptions, something that wouldn't have been necessary had this Starliner mission not gone so far off its mission plan.\n\nBasically I'm thinking there must be a load of consequential losses to NASA as a result of this Starliner failure and I really hope that NASA is going to be able to come after Boeing for compensation for disruption to its other activities once everyone is safe. I fear though that there might be specific wording in the Starliner contract precluding any Boeing liability for NASA consequential losses but I hope I'm wrong.",

On the other hand, this puts Butch and Suni in greater danger later in the mission if thruster failures prevent successful reentry. I think the software changes they are talking about for automatic undocking will be incorporating additional contingencies for thruster failures which have only been worked out during the last few weeks. NASA is being cagy about this because it raises questions about the safety of the automated undocking in 2022.",
